            "data": "Who do I acknowledge first and how do I acknowledge the millions of cricket supporters who have\nstood by me throughout my career? My simple answer is to dedicate this book to those fans for their\nunwavering support and encouragement.\nThe others who need to be thanked profoundly must quite obviously start with Anjali, my devoted\nwife and partner in everything, who felt I could and should tell my story for posterity. My readers will\nknow if I have managed to do so well enough.\nSincere thanks must also go to the following:\nAjit, who grew up with me and made me the cricketer I was, and who shared my passion for telling\nmy story. Thanks to him for reading and commenting on the drafts.\nArjun and Sara, who when they read this book will know how much I have always loved them and\nhow I felt at not being with them more in their growing-up years.\nAparna Santhanam, family friend and much more, who was a real inspiration at the writing stage.\nShe read each chapter and her suggestions proved invaluable.\nVinod Naidu, my manager and good friend, for putting the idea of an autobiography to me in the\nfirst place and more importantly for being someone I have always been able to depend on for guidance\nin commercial matters over the past decade.\nAmit Bhangar, for constantly but gently reminding me of the deadlines and pushing me to complete\nthe book in the time frame we were given.\nRoddy Bloomfield, my publisher, who has worked closely with me on the book from start to finish\nand who is a man whose judgement I have been able to trust; Fiona Rose, his able and helpful editorial\nassistant  at  Hodder;  Tim  Waller,  the  external  editor,  who  has  helped  to  shape  and  refine  the\nmanuscript.\nFinally, to Boria Majumdar, friend and co-writer. By sheer persistence he managed to persuade me\nover the last three years to spend endless sessions reflecting on every aspect of my life. His infectious\nenthusiasm  and  intelligent  questions  got  me  fully  involved  in  animated,  thoughtful  and  enjoyable\ndiscussion. Through his commitment and focus he has been able to convey the whole story in my own\nwords, impressively expressing my thoughts.\n"

            "data": "On 16 November 2013, my cricketing journey finally came to an end at the Wankhede Stadium. After\nsomehow  managing  to  complete  my  farewell  speech,  I  was  having  a  conversation  with  my  family,\ntrying  to  soak  in  every  moment,  when  my  team-mate  Virat  Kohli  walked  up  to  me.  He  said,  ‘Paaji\naapne kaha tha aap ko yaad dilane ke liye ki aapko pitch pe jana hain.’ (You asked me to remind you\nthat you had to go to the pitch one final time.) To be honest, I hadn’t forgotten; I was just trying to put\nthe  moment  off  for  a  little  longer.  It  was  to  be  my  final  visit  to  the  22  yards  that  had  nurtured  and\ncared for me for so long.\nAs I walked across the outfield I knew so well, my mind was a complete blank. A lump was forming\nin my throat as I reached the pitch to pay my final regards. I was there for barely fifteen seconds and\nall I said was, ‘Thank you for taking care of me.’ As I headed back to the pavilion for the last time, my\nmind was suddenly a muddle of memories. In a matter of seconds I had traversed the entire twenty-\nfour-year  journey  of  my  career  –  from  my  first  net  session  with  my  coach  Ramakant Achrekar,  to\ngetting out for 74 in my final Test innings against the West Indies.\nIt seems to me that no autobiography can claim to document every detail of the author’s life. That’s\nimpossible. There are bound to be issues that can’t be written about for one reason or another, events\nthat are too personal or perhaps too sensitive. Yet I have set out to make this account of my career as\nclose  to  the  full  story  as  I  can.  Many  of  the  events  I  describe  are,  of  course,  well-known  to  cricket\nfans, but I have also tried to talk about a number of things I have not addressed in public before, some\nof them a little embarrassing, and I hope that readers will find plenty to interest them.\nBefore starting this book, I had to think long and hard about whether it was the right thing to do. It\nwasn’t an easy decision. I am not in the habit of being sensational for the sake of it or saying things to\nruffle feathers. That’s just not me. However, I knew that if I agreed to write my story, I would have to\nbe completely honest, as that’s the way I have always played the game.\nSo here I am, at the end of my final innings, having taken that last walk back to the pavilion, ready\nto recount as many incidents as I can remember from a career in which I was lucky enough to be able\nto spend my time Playing It My Way.\n"

            "data": "‘Son, life is like a book. It has numerous chapters. It also has many a lesson in it. It is made up of a\nwide variety of experiences and resembles a pendulum where success and failure, joy and sorrow are\nmerely extremes of the central reality. The lessons to be learnt from success and failure are equally\nimportant. More often than not, failure and sorrow are bigger teachers than success and happiness.\nYou are a cricketer and sportsman. You are fortunate to be representing your country, and that is a\ngreat honour. But never forget that this too is just another chapter in the book. Typically, let’s say a\nperson lives for seventy or eighty years or so. How many years will you play sport? Twenty years; if\nyou are very good, maybe even twenty-five years. Even by that yardstick, you will live the majority of\nyour years outside the sphere of professional sport. This clearly means that there is more to life than\ncricket. I am asking you, son, to keep a pleasant disposition and maintain a balanced nature. Do not\nallow success to breed arrogance in you. If you remain humble, people will give you love and respect\neven  after  you  have  finished  with  the  game.  As  a  parent,  I  would  be  happier  hearing  people  say,\n“Sachin is a good human being” than “Sachin is a great cricketer” any day.’\nMy father’s words, which I often heard while growing up, encapsulate my life’s philosophy.\nI  was  born  to  a  very  close-knit  Maharashtrian  family  in  Mumbai’s  Bandra  East  and  lived  in  the\nSahitya  Sahawas  colony,  a  residential  co-operative  for  writers.  I  am  one  of  four  children,  with  two\nbrothers and a sister. Nitin, Ajit and Savita are all older than me, and not only am I the youngest in the\nfamily but I was also the worst behaved.\nMy  father,  Ramesh  Tendulkar,  was  an  acclaimed  Marathi  poet,  critic  and  professor,  while  my\nmother, Rajani, worked for the Life Insurance Corporation of India. Humility and modesty were their\nhallmarks and I owe a lot of my personality to my upbringing. Despite all my unreasonableness and\nall the embarrassments I caused them, my parents never gave up on me. In fact, I have often wondered\njust how they managed to cope with such a naughty child. Though he must have been pushed to the\nlimits sometimes, my father would never shout at me and was always patient when dealing with my\nmischief. This added to my respect for my father as I grew older. Losing him during the 1999 World\nCup  in  England  remains  one  of  the  most  traumatic  moments  of  my  life  and  I  will  forever  remain\nindebted to him for helping me become the human being that I am.\nMy mother, the best cook in the world for me, will do anything to see a smile on my face. She used\nto make the most delicious fish and prawn curry, baigan bharta  and varan bhaat (lentils and rice) for\nus at home, and I owe my appetite and love of food to her. I fondly remember lying on her lap after\neating delicious home-cooked meals, as she sang the most beautiful songs while trying to get me off\nto sleep. Listening to her while dozing off at the end of the day instilled in me a love for music that\nhas remained with me to this day.\nMy brothers, Nitin and Ajit, have always backed me in my endeavours and, on the cricket side, I\nowe a lot to Ajit, who is ten years older than me and was a good club cricketer himself but decided to\nsacrifice  his  own  career  to  help  me  achieve  my  potential. As  I  said  in  my  farewell  speech  after  my\nfinal Test, Ajit and I lived the dream together and he was always my most trusted critic and sounding\nboard. I may have scored the runs, but Ajit was always there with me in spirit, trying to put me right\nwhenever I made a mistake. Even after my last Test innings, we had a discussion about how I had got\nout  and  what  I  had  done  wrong,  despite  knowing  I’d  never  play  for  India  again. Ajit  is  not  just  my\nbrother, but my closest friend as well. He was always available when I needed him and always put my\ncricket before his own work.\nMy eldest brother, Nitin, easily the most creative of the siblings, was the strict disciplinarian in the\nTendulkar household and helped rein in my exuberance when my mother had almost given up on me.\nHe not only sketches really well, but is also an accomplished writer and poet and has recently written\nsongs  for  a  movie.  Nitin,  initially  a  chemistry  teacher,  subsequently  worked  for  Air  India  and  I\nremember on one occasion, when I was ten, his flight was delayed and he had to wait at the Centaur\n(now Sahara Star) hotel in Mumbai. Ajit and I went to have dinner in his room and for the first time in\nmy life I tasted tandoori chicken, which subsequently became one of my favourite dishes.\nSavita, my sister, gave me my first cricket bat. She travelled to Kashmir for a holiday when I was\nfive  and  brought  me  back  a  Kashmir  willow  bat.  She  is  easily  the  calmest  of  the  siblings  and  has  a\nvery  reserved  and  composed  demeanour.  She  stays  unruffled  in  difficult  situations  and  we  often\nconsulted her on critical matters while growing up. When she got married, I, not knowing much about\nrituals  and  customs,  tried  to  insist  that  my  brother-in-law  should  come  and  stay  with  us  rather  than\nSavita having to go away. I did not want to let her go and I must say I missed her terribly when she\nleft home.\nNever sitting still\nUndoubtedly  I  had  a  fascinating  childhood.  My  early  years  were  never  boring;  in  fact,  quite  the\nopposite. I can trace a lot of the stamina and inner strength that sustained me during my cricket career\nto those early years, which were full of fun.\nWe  had  moved  to  Sahitya  Sahawas  in  1971.  In  my  growing-up  years,  there  was  a  great  deal  of\nconstruction work taking place there. This gave me and my friends the opportunity to play quite a few\npranks on our neighbours. While we were never violent and never caused bodily harm to others, I’m\nashamed  to  admit  we  sometimes  enjoyed  having  a  laugh  at  the  expense  of  other  members  of  the\ncolony. For us it was fun, plain and simple, but looking back at some of the mischief we got up to now\nis rather embarrassing.\nOne of our regular tricks was to dig a deep hole in the sand left behind by the contractors and cover\nit with newspapers before disguising it with sand. Then we’d deliberately lure people to walk over it.\nAs they sank into the crater, we’d be in fits of laughter. Another was to pour water on unsuspecting\npassers-by from our apartment on the fourth floor, and I remember that feasting on mangoes picked\nfrom trees we weren’t supposed to touch was also a favourite pastime. The forbidden nature of the act\nmade it even more compelling and the complaints that would follow did little to put us off. Finally –\nand this is very embarrassing, looking back now – my friends and I would take pride in locking people\nin  their  flats.  It  wasn’t  dangerous,  but  the  resulting  delay,  which  must  have  caused  them  immense\nfrustration, seemed very funny at the time.\nAs a child I was first enrolled at the Indian Education Society’s New English School in Bandra. I\nwas a reasonable student and though I was never a class-topper, I did not languish at the bottom either.\nWhile  school  wasn’t  altogether  boring,  the  best  time  of  the  year  was  the  two-month-long  summer\nbreak. During the holiday period, I’d hurry down from our apartment at 9 a.m. and would be out in the\nsun  playing  for  the  rest  of  the  day.  The  domestic  help,  Lakshmibai,  (a  common  phenomenon  in\nhouseholds  where  both  parents  were  working)  would  have  to  bring  down  my  glass  of  milk  and\nsometimes she would also have to bring out my lunch, because I’d refuse to go up to our apartment.\nThe sweltering heat was never a distraction and I’d be out playing till late in the evening. In fact,\neven  after  most  of  my  friends  had  disappeared  to  their  apartments,  I  would  be  out  alone  trying  to\namuse myself. There were seven or eight blocks in the colony and sometimes I’d just run around them\nto expend energy. I’d run seven or eight laps on the trot and do so barefoot. Only when my brother\nNitin instructed me to go up would I rush back. I was a little scared of him. He generally didn’t say\nmuch  to  me  but  when  he  did  it  was  always  the  final  word.  If  my  mother  grew  tired  of  trying  to\npersuade me to come in, she would ask Nitin to perform the task.\nIn our two-bedroom apartment, the four children would all sleep together in one of the bedrooms. I\nwas always the last one to drop off and would keep tossing and turning as the others drifted off. Often,\nwhile they’d be lying north–south, I’d end up stretched out east–west, and I’d receive a mouthful when\nthey woke up to find me lying across them. The reprimands were part of the bonding and I never took\nthem to heart. The whole experience brought us closer together.\nA first taste of Chinese food\nAs a child I loved food. I grew up eating my mother’s wonderful Maharashtrian home cooking and it\nwasn’t till I was nine years old that I first tried Chinese food. In the early 1980s Chinese cuisine was\nbecoming popular in Mumbai and, having heard so much about it, my colony friends made a plan to\ngo out for a meal together. We each contributed ten rupees – which was a lot of money for me at the\ntime  –  and  I  was  excited  about  trying  something  new.  The  evening,  however,  turned  out  to  be  a\ndisaster as I paid the price for being one of the youngest in the group.\nIn the restaurant we ordered chicken and sweetcorn soup as a starter. We were sitting at a long table\nand  by  the  time  the  soup  travelled  to  me  at  the  far  end,  there  was  hardly  anything  left.  The  older\nmembers  of  the  gang  had  finished  off  most  of  it,  leaving  very  little  for  us  younger  ones.  The  same\nthing happened with the fried rice and chow mein and I barely managed to get two spoonfuls of each.\nThe older boys had a great evening at our expense but I returned home hungry and thirsty.\nDreaming of a bicycle\nAs I kid I could also be quite obstinate. While most of my friends had their own bicycles, I did not and\nI was determined to have one. My father didn’t really like saying no to me and tried to placate me by\nsaying he’d buy me one in a few weeks. From a financial point of view, it wasn’t easy to bring up four\nchildren in Mumbai, but our parents never let us feel any pressure. Not knowing what they had to go\nthrough, I remained determined to have my bicycle and refused to go outside and play till I had a new\none to show off. It seems a little ridiculous now, but the truth is I didn’t go out to play for a whole\nweek.  I  just  stood  on  the  balcony  and  sulked  and  tried  to  guilt-trip  my  parents  into  buying  me  a\nbicycle.\nIt was on one of these days that I gave them a real scare. Ours was a fourth-floor apartment with a\nsmall  balcony  with  a  grille. As  a  small  child,  I  couldn’t  see  over  the  top  and,  with  curiosity  often\ngetting the better of me, I would try to get my head through the grille. On this occasion it resulted in\ndisaster. While I succeeded in pushing my head through, I couldn’t get it back in and was stuck there\nfor more than thirty minutes. My parents were flustered to start with, but quickly regained composure.\nAfter plenty of oil was squirted on my head, my mother finally pulled me out.\nSeeing  my  desperation  and  worried  about  what  I  might  get  up  to  next,  my  father  rearranged  his\nfinances to buy me a brand-new bicycle. I still don’t know what adjustments he had to make to do so.\nNor was I concerned at the time. All I cared about was the bicycle and I immediately showed it off to\nall  my  friends.  However,  my  joy  was  short-lived  as  I  met  with  a  serious  accident  within  hours  of\ngetting my precious new bicycle. A fruit and vegetable seller pushing a cart had come to the colony.\nAs we came face to face, I was riding too fast and couldn’t slow down in time. New to the bicycle, I\napplied the wrong brake and, bang, I hit the cart head on, lost control and was tossed into the air. As I\nlooked down on the world, my only concern was what would happen to my new bicycle. When I came\ncrashing  back  down,  one  of  the  spokes  went  through  the  skin  just  above  my  right  eye.  The  cut  was\ndeep and blood was gushing out of the wound. Far more importantly, my bicycle was badly damaged.\nNews soon reached home that I had hurt myself and my parents were very concerned. I tried to be\nbrave  and  made  out  that  it  was  only  a  minor  wound.  It  wasn’t,  and  my  father  had  to  take  me  to  a\nplastic surgeon friend of his, who put eight stitches just above the right eye. He gave me a couple of\ninjections  and  I  returned  home  feeling  sorry  for  myself  and  frustrated.  My  mangled  bicycle  was\nparked close to our apartment, but my father told me that I wasn’t allowed near it until the wound had\nhealed and that he’d get it repaired in the interim. This time I had to give in, knowing it was the only\nway I’d get it back.\nAs soon as I’d recovered, I resumed cycling, and within a few months had become an accomplished\nbiker. I could slow-cycle better than most kids and even went on to win a race organized in the colony.\nI rode with passion and within a few months had developed the ability to slide on one wheel, which\ntook all my friends by surprise. In areas of the colony where there was sand on the concrete, I could\nget  the  wheels  to  slide  for  ten  to  fifteen  feet,  with  my  body  bent  at  forty-five  degrees.  I  wasn’t\nbothered about what this was doing to the tyres, of course, as the larger the distance covered, the better\nI felt. Showing off my skills used to give me a thrill and what added to the fun was that I had learnt\nthese tricks in quick time.\nNevertheless, things went wrong sometimes, causing me plenty of embarrassment and pain. In fact,\nI think I can trace my ability to withstand pain to my exploits as a child. I’d often get cut or hurt but\nrarely  mentioned  these  minor  accidents  to  anyone  at  home.  So  much  so  that  my  father  got  into  the\nhabit of examining my body when I was sleeping to check whether I’d injured myself. If he saw me\nwince in pain, he’d know I’d done something to myself again and he would take me to the doctor the\nnext day.\nNo matter what I’d done, though, my father would never shout or scream at me. More often than\nnot, he’d try to set out the reasons why I should or shouldn’t do certain things, and his explanations\nleft behind a lasting impact. My father’s sense of reason was his biggest virtue and I try to act in the\nsame way with my children.\nIn the wars again\nI  had  a  lot  of  adventures  as  a  child,  but  one  that  stands  out  is  when  I  was  cut  under  my  eye  while\nplaying at Shivaji Park, the breeding ground of cricketers in Mumbai, and had to return home covered\nin  blood.  I  was  captaining  my  team  in  a  match  at  Shivaji  Park  when  I  was  twelve  and  after  our\nwicketkeeper got injured I asked my team-mates if anyone could keep wicket. No one volunteered and\nsomewhat  reluctantly  I  stepped  up  to  the  challenge,  even  though  I’d  never  tried  it  before.  I  was\nuncomfortable standing in the unfamiliar position behind the stumps and soon missed a nick. The ball\ncame at me fast and, even before I could react, it hit me smack in the face, just missing my eye. The\ncut was deep and there was a lot of blood.\nI didn’t have the money to pay for a taxi home and was embarrassed at the thought of getting on a\nbus with a bloodied face. I asked a friend of mine to give me a lift on his bicycle, and anyone who\nknows Mumbai will realize what a difficult task that is, especially with heavy cricket kitbags in tow.\nThere was a busy flyover between East and West Bandra, which my friend found too steep with such a\nheavy load. As a result, I had to get off and walk, with commuters gaping at me in shock. A young kid\nwith a bloodied face and bloodstained shirt lugging his cricket kit over a flyover wasn’t an everyday\nsight.\nWhen  I  got  home,  I  was  relieved  to  find  my  parents  out  at  work.  My  grandmother  was  in  the\napartment, but I asked her not to panic and told her it was a minor injury. She said she knew how to\nhandle  it  and  put  warm  turmeric  over  the  cut,  an  age-old  Indian Ayurvedic  treatment  for  cuts  and\nbruises. I did not bother telling anyone else and the injury healed faster than I expected.\nSuffice  to  say,  that  wasn’t  the  only  time  I  got  hurt  while  playing  cricket  as  a  kid.  Injuries  were\nfrequent because we played on half-baked and overused pitches and our coach insisted we should bat\nwithout helmets and learn to leave balls by swaying out of the way. On such wickets, injuries were a\ncertainty, but they hardened us for the grind in the future and as a result I was never scared of getting\nhurt. It was all part of being a professional sportsman. However, the ability to withstand pain didn’t\nmean  I  didn’t  take  due  precautions  and  exposed  myself  to  injuries  unnecessarily  –  something  I  was\nonce surprised to be questioned about as a fourteen-year-old during a match at the Wankhede Stadium.\nThe match, which involved Mumbai’s Ranji Trophy Probables, started early in the morning and the\nplan was for a pair of fast bowlers to bowl at the batsmen for five or six overs before they were rested\nand a new pair were asked to bowl with a new ball. The aim was to give batsmen practice against a\nfast swinging ball. To make things even more difficult, a lot of grass had been left on the track. I went\nout to bat early in our innings and was wearing my Under-15 cap. I didn’t have a helmet at the time\nand  the  Under-15  cap  was  the  only  headgear  I  possessed.  Raju  Kulkarni,  who  was  by  then  an\naccomplished  Test  bowler  for  India,  was  livid  when  he  saw  me  taking  guard  in  just  a  cap. All  the\nsenior  batsmen  had  helmets,  so  how  dare  I,  a  fourteen-year-old,  wander  out  without  proper  head\nprotection? At  first,  I  couldn’t  work  out  why  he  was  so  upset.  He  bowled  a  barrage  of  bouncers  –\nthough in hindsight I realize they were intended to teach me a lesson rather than to hurt me – but I\nmanaged to stay calm enough to sway out of the way. When I finally understood the reason behind his\nanger, I did not know how to explain to him that Achrekar Sir had not allowed me to wear a helmet in\nschool cricket – I wasn’t attempting to be brave at all. It was only later, when I was selected in the\nMumbai team and came to know Raju well, that I finally told him the real reason for not wearing a\nhelmet.\nMusic: my second love\nMusic was a constant presence in the Tendulkar household. All my siblings would regularly listen to\nthe radio and always followed the weekly Hindi film music programme Binaca Geetmala (Garland of\nsongs),  anchored  by  the  well-known  radio  personality  Ameen  Sayani.  As  a  result,  while  I  was  too\nyoung  to  understand  much,  I  was  exposed  to  music  from  a  very  early  age.  The  exposure  increased\nwhen my father bought a cassette player, which miraculously allowed everyone to listen to music of\ntheir choice. Both my brothers were fans of the famous ghazal singer Pankaj Udhas. I couldn’t really\nappreciate  his  songs  then,  but  I  was  always  in  the  room  when  they  were  played  and  was  privy  to\ndiscussions  on  the  nuances  and  finer  points  of  music.  On  one  occasion  Nitin  went  to  Dubai  and\nbrought back Pankaj Udhas’s newly released album. Even though he didn’t get home till midnight, we\nall waited up to listen to the cassette as soon as he got back, with our grandmother making us tea well\npast one in the morning.\nIt was natural that music should soon become my second love after cricket and it has remained that\nway  ever  since.  I  enjoy  listening  to  all  kinds  of  Indian  music,  ranging  from  film  songs  to  the  more\nclassical variety, and I always feel relaxed with my headphones on. Later, during tours abroad, I began\nto  pick  up  on  Western  music  and  I  now  love  listening  to  Pink  Floyd,  U2,  Dire  Straits  and  a  host  of\nothers.  I  passed  that  taste  for  Western  music  on  to Ajit,  and  it  is  now  an  important  feature  of  the\nTendulkar household.\nTurning to cricket\nBesides  cricket  and  music,  I  was  also  a  big  fan  of  tennis  as  a  child.  John  McEnroe,  the  legendary\nAmerican player, was my favourite. As a ten-year-old I would mimic McEnroe’s look and antics, to\nthe  extent  that  I  grew  my  hair  into  a  curly  mop  and  walked  around  wearing  a  headband.  I  was\nfascinated  by  the  battles  between  Björn  Borg  and  McEnroe  and  for  a  while  I  even  contemplated\nchoosing tennis over cricket.\nAjit knew about my obsession with tennis but had also seen me play cricket with my colony friends.\nHe had observed my natural bat swing and that’s what led him to believe that I might turn out to be a\ngood batsman if groomed properly – though he never imposed anything on me.\nWhat he would do is give me both a tennis racket and a cricket bat and take me up to the terrace to\nhave  a  hit.  He  threw  tennis  balls  to  me  while  I  took  turns  at  tennis  and  cricket.  We  didn’t  have  too\nmany  balls  then  and  if  they  bounced  over  the  walls  of  the  terrace,  I  would  quickly  run  down  four\nfloors  and  fetch  them  (there  were  no  elevators  then,  something  that  explains  the  secret  behind  my\nstrong legs!). It was clear to Ajit that I enjoyed myself far more while playing cricket. However, the\nepisode that led him to take the next step and bring me along to Ramakant Achrekar’s summer cricket\ncamp in 1984, at the age of eleven, had nothing to do with cricket.\nThe  turn  to  cricket  was  prompted  by  a  group  of  friends  –  myself,  Sunil  Harshe  and  Avinash\nGowariker – getting into a spot of trouble. At the time in India Doordarshan, the national broadcaster,\nwould show a classic film every Sunday, and on this fateful day it was Guide, starring Dev Anand, one\nof India’s legendary actors. Most of the residents of our colony were engrossed in the film, allowing\nus three the opportunity to climb up one of the trees and take some mangoes. Sunil, who was on the\nheavy side, and I were on a branch together, but it broke and we fell with a crash from quite a height.\nAs  we  got  up  and  tried  to  run  away,  we  were  caught  and  brought  to  book.  It  was  evident  that\nsomething needed to be done to channel my energies, especially during the school summer holidays.\nRamakant Achrekar’s coaching camp, where a lot of Mumbai’s top cricketers had learnt their game,\nwas Ajit’s answer.\n"

            "title": "LEARNING THE GAME\n",
            "data": "From a very early age I played tennis-ball cricket with my colony friends. I loved watching cricket on\ntelevision  and  in  our  games  I  often  tried  to  emulate  the  mannerisms  of  my  favourite  players,  Sunil\nGavaskar and the West Indian legend Viv Richards. But it wasn’t just the batsmen that I studied. I also\nloved bowling and tried my hand at different kinds of deliveries – medium pace, off-spin and leg-spin\n– all with a tennis ball, of course. I even experimented with tactics like the slower ball and bowling\nfrom wide of the stump. Throughout my career I have actually bowled a lot in the nets. As soon as I’d\nfinished with my batting I’d pick up a ball and start bowling to whichever batsmen were around at the\ntime.\nThe  transition  from  playing  with  a  tennis  ball  to  playing  with  a  cricket  ball  happened  under  the\nwatchful  eyes  of  Ramakant  Achrekar,  then  cricket  coach  at  Shardashram  Vidyamandir  school.\nAchrekar Sir, as I refer to him, started playing cricket at the age of eleven in 1943, which is the age I\nwas when I went to him for the first time. He played for a number of Mumbai clubs, including the Gul\nMohar  Mills  and  Mumbai  Port,  and  played  a  first-class  match  for  the  State  Bank  of  India  against\nHyderabad  in  1963.  When  I  was  growing  up  he  was  undoubtedly  one  of  the  most  accomplished\ncoaches in Mumbai.\nFrom his own schooldays at Balmohan Vidyamandir, my brother Ajit knew that compared to other\nschools in Mumbai, Shardashram was by far the best organized in its approach to cricket, and that’s\nwhy  he  took  me  along  to Achrekar  Sir’s  nets  in  Shivaji  Park  to  try  my  luck  at  being  a  part  of  his\nsummer camp.\nAnyone could come for a trial at the camp but then it was up to Sir to decide who to accept. There\nwere nets for players from all age groups, starting with the sub-junior (Under-15) and junior (Under-\n17) levels. I was eleven years old and trialled at the sub-junior nets to start with. The Mumbai Cricket\nAssociation  had  an  Under-15  team  and  most  candidates  from  the  sub-junior  section  eventually  vied\nfor a position in that team.\nI had never batted in nets before and felt somewhat overawed with so many people around. When I\nwas asked to bat, I was not at all comfortable. With Sir watching me so closely, I failed to make an\nimpact. After  I  had  finished  batting,  Sir  called Ajit  aside  and  informed  him  that  I  was  perhaps  too\nyoung to make the camp and suggested that he should bring me back when I was a little older. I wasn’t\nparty  to  this  conversation  and  had  no  idea  what  was  discussed  at  the  time.  My  induction  into  the\nMumbai cricket circuit could have ended in failure – but for Ajit’s insistence.\nHaving seen me play in the colony, Ajit knew I was capable of performing far better than I had in\nfront of Achrekar Sir. He explained that I was nervous and asked Sir to give me one more opportunity.\nHowever,  he  suggested  that  while  doing  so  Sir  should  pretend  to  go  away  and  then  watch  from  a\ndistance. Sir agreed. Before long I was asked to bat again and, without Sir’s trained eyes scrutinizing\nme – or so I thought – I felt more at ease and soon started to hit the ball well. This time, Sir agreed to\nlet me join the camp. I was delighted and I must say it was an opportunity that transformed my life.\nParticipants in the summer camp had to pay an admission fee of 65 rupees (less than a pound) and a\nmonthly fee of 10 rupees (10 pence). In my case I don’t remember having to pay the monthly fee after\nthe first few months. The camp involved a session every morning and evening at Shivaji Park. I would\npractise between 7.30 a.m. and 10.30 a.m. before making my way home for lunch, then I’d come back\nin the afternoon and train till late evening. The schedule was rigorous and I would be exhausted by the\nend of the day. Travelling to Shivaji Park took forty minutes from my house in Bandra and I had to\ncatch an early-morning bus to make it on time.\nFor the first few days Ajit accompanied me, to get me used to the routine, but once I was familiar\nwith the journey, I’d travel to the camp on my own. During the bus journeys he would talk to me about\nthe nuances of batting, and I always enjoyed these conversations a lot. In fact, the one thing that I have\nkept  with  me  all  my  career  is  a  note  that Ajit  gave  me  containing  some  thoughts  about  batting.  It\nserved as a very personal coaching manual.\nAs  a  child  I  had  only  one  set  of  cricket  clothes  and  the  routine  was  to  wash  them  as  soon  as  I’d\nreturned from the morning session. While I had my lunch, the clothes would dry out in the sun and I\nwould wear them again in the afternoon. The pattern was repeated in the evening, so that I could use\nthe  same  set  of  clothes  the  following  morning.  The  system  worked  well  –  apart  from  my  pockets.\nThere was never quite enough time for the pockets to dry out completely and for the entire duration of\nthe camp I played with wet pockets.\nChanging schools\nBy the middle of the summer camp, Sir had started taking an active interest in my batting and at the\nend of the two months informed Ajit that I had the potential to be a good cricketer if I practised all\nyear round. He had made a few changes to the way I batted and the impact was immediate. I was now\npractising with the older boys from the junior section. However, my school – the New English School\nin Bandra – did not have cricket facilities and Sir was keen for me to change schools if I wanted to\npursue cricket seriously.\nOne evening Sir called my father and asked if he would speak to me about changing schools. Ajit\nwas in the room with my father at the time and they both accepted that it was necessary, if cricket was\nto  be  my  priority.  However,  neither  of  them  ever  forced  anything  on  me  and  when  I  got  home  they\nasked  me  what  I  thought  of  the  suggestion.  By  that  time  I  had  started  enjoying  my  batting  and  was\nkeen to play throughout the year. Without any hesitation I agreed to the move. My father sat me down\nand explained that while he did not have any objections to me changing schools, I should do so only if\nI was really serious about playing cricket. I assured him I was, and so it was agreed that I should move\nto Shardashram Vidyamandir, where Achrekar Sir was a cricket coach.\nThe move meant I lost contact with a lot of my New English school friends, but I soon made new\nones at Shardashram, mostly through cricket. All the cricketers in the school were friends with each\nother and even though we were in different divisions and sections, such things hardly mattered. We\nplayed together during lunch breaks and discussed cricket all the time, and Achrekar Sir would coach\nus  after  school.  Cricket  was  fast  becoming  my  first  love.  All  my  excess  energies  were  getting\nchannelled  into  cricket,  which  acted  as  a  kind  of  a  safety  valve.  Everyone  at  home  was  very\nsupportive, but my father always said that all he wanted me to do was give it my best effort without\nworrying about the results.\nJoining Shardashram undoubtedly helped my cricket a great deal. It allowed me the opportunity to\nplay competitive matches regularly and my game rapidly improved as a result. There’s nothing like\nplaying matches to get better, because only in competitive situations are you forced to out-think the\nopposition and improvise. Net practice can never be a substitute for matchplay and Achrekar Sir was\nan ardent believer in this principle.\nI did not excel in my first ever match for my club, the Kamath Memorial Club, run by Achrekar Sir,\nwhich a host of my colony friends came to watch, I was out for a golden duck. I was the star batsman\nin the colony and it was natural that my friends would come to see me play. It was embarrassing to be\nbowled  first  ball  and  I  had  to  make  a  series  of  excuses,  saying  the  ball  had  kept  low  and  the  pitch\nwasn’t good enough for batting. In the second match I got out for another duck and it was only in our\nthird  game  that  I  managed  to  score  my  first  run,  having  survived  seven  deliveries.  I  was  seriously\nrelieved to get off the mark. I used to keep a diary at the time that contained all the information from\nthese games, but unfortunately I don’t have them any more.\nMy debut for the school wasn’t quite as bad and I managed to score 24 runs in the match, which we\nwon  comfortably.  However,  I  will  always  remember  the  game  for  other  reasons,  because  I  learnt  a\nvery  important  personal  lesson.  It  taught  me  never  to  resort  to  unethical  ways  and  to  play  the  sport\nwith  honesty  and  integrity  at  all  times.  The  incident  in  question  involved  my  first  appearance  in  a\nnewspaper, which should have been a happy occurrence. The rule in Mumbai at the time was that a\nplayer’s name only appeared in print if he had scored 30 runs. I had made 24, but there were a lot of\nextras in the team’s innings and the scorer decided to credit six extras to me, increasing my score to\n30.  The  scorer’s  logic  was  that  it  didn’t  matter  because  the  overall  score  did  not  change.  I  had\nconsented to this without appreciating what I was getting into. The next morning, when my name duly\nappeared in a Mumbai paper, Achrekar Sir was seriously unhappy with what I had done and told me\noff for consenting to have runs added to my personal tally when I hadn’t scored them. I acknowledged\nmy mistake and promised never to allow such a thing to happen again.\nThe first-match jinx continued in my first season for the Mumbai Under-15 team in Pune in 1985. I\nwas  only  twelve  then  and  travelled  to  Pune  with  just  95  rupees  in  my  pocket.  This  was  to  be\nsupplemented with the little allowance we were given during the tour, which lasted more than a week.\nIn my only match for Mumbai I was run out. I was batting with someone from my school who was\nolder than me and because he was a faster runner he completed the runs quicker and pushed for a third\nrun  that  was  not  on. As  a  result  I  was  run  out  and  I  returned  to  the  pavilion  with  tears  in  my  eyes.\nThoughtfully, two veteran Mumbai cricketers, Milind Rege and Vasu Paranjpe, consoled me, saying\nthe run just wasn’t there and I shouldn’t have been called to go for it.\nIt rained a lot in Pune in the next few days and as it turned out this was my only innings. As a result\nI was not picked for the West Zone Under-15 team and was upset because a few of my team-mates\nwho  had  not  played  a  single  ball  had  been  chosen  ahead  of  me.  To  add  to  my  distress,  I  ran  out  of\nmoney because I spent it all on snacks and fast food – and arrived at Dadar station with no fare for the\nbus  home.  I  had  to  walk  back  to  Shivaji  Park  to  my  uncle’s  carrying  two  big  bags  and  cried  all  the\nway. My aunt was very concerned when she saw me and asked what the matter was. I did not tell her\nthat I hadn’t been selected for the West Zone team and all I said was I was not feeling too well.\nMy first earnings from cricket\nPlaying for my school regularly helped me learn the art of scoring big runs and batting for a long time.\nDuring school holidays I played practice matches for my club almost every day. In fact, in my first\nyear at Shardashram I played fifty-five practice matches during the summer break of sixty days. My\nsummer sessions used to start at 7.30 a.m. and I’d bat for two hours, split into five net sessions. All of\nthese sessions were rigorous and required intense concentration. After the morning session, I would go\nstraight into the practice match, which would end at 4.30 p.m., then my evening session would start at\n5 p.m., after only a thirty-minute break. During the break Sir would often give me some money to go\nand have a vada pav (a popular Mumbai fast food) or a soft drink as a treat.\nBetween 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. I’d have five more net sessions, before a final session of fifteen minutes,\nwhen Sir would place a one-rupee coin on top of the stumps and if I managed to avoid getting out, the\ncoin was mine. In this session every bowler in the camp would come and have a go at me, with some\nsixty to seventy boys fielding. Even if the ball was caught 90 yards away, which was a distance bigger\nthan the boundary length at any school ground in India, I was out. It meant I had to hit every ball along\nthe ground to survive those intense fifteen minutes. It was a serious challenge but with time I started\nenjoying this session the most. Winning the one-rupee coin used to give me immense satisfaction and\ntaught me how to concentrate even when physically drained.\nAt  the  end  of  it  all,  Sir  would  tell  me  to  run  two  full  circuits  of  Shivaji  Park  with  my  pads  and\ngloves on. That was the last part of my training and I’d be completely exhausted by the end of it all. It\nwas a routine I would repeat right through during my summer holidays and it helped me to build up\nphysical and mental stamina.\nOccasionally my father came to take me home and I would always ask him to treat me to a special\nfruit  cocktail  at  a  juice  centre  near  the  club.  While  this  regular  demand  was  a  little  unreasonable,\nbecause at the time I did not realize that my parents also had to take care of the needs of my brothers\nand sister, my father would invariably end up giving me what I wanted, just to see me happy.\nOn other days, when I made my way home from Shivaji Park on my own, I’d often fall asleep on the\nbus  –  if  I  managed  to  sit  down,  that  is. Anyone  who  has  been  on  a  Mumbai  bus  at  peak  hours  will\nknow just how difficult it is to get a seat. On days when I wasn’t so lucky, it was still a challenge just\nto stand with the kitbag, because the bus conductors would inevitably complain about me taking up the\nspace  of  another  passenger.  It  could  be  embarrassing  because  the  conductors  were  often  rude  and\nwould sometimes ask me to buy two tickets. I didn’t have the money for a second ticket and I had to\nlearn  to  take  these  remarks  in  my  stride.  Dirty  clothes  often  added  to  the  embarrassment. After  I’d\nplayed in them all day, the clothes were usually in quite a smelly state and this was the cause of a lot\nof discomfort and guilt on the way home. With time I evolved a way of wrapping the kitbag around\nme. Just as the helmet and pads became a part of me while batting, so the kitbag became an extension\nof me on the bus.\nSo when people ask me these days if I have ever been on public transport, I tell them I used to travel\non crowded buses and trains four times a day during my first year at Shardashram. And from a very\nyoung age I used to do it alone. I’d often take the bus or train from Bandra to Churchgate, and it was\nall a great learning experience. Within a few months I had made a lot of friends and we had great fun\ntravelling together to matches.\nMoving to Shivaji Park\nAfter a year of commuting between Bandra and school, my family realized that the daily travel was\ngetting  too  much.  I  had  to  catch  a  connecting  bus  midway  into  the  journey  and  if  I  missed  the\nconnection I’d be late for school. Also, the one-and-a-half-hour journey would end up exhausting me\nand it had started to have an impact on my training time. More worryingly, I had twice fallen sick in\nthe first year of my daily commute to Shardashram and had also contracted jaundice.\nIt  was  decided  that  I  should  move  in  with  my  uncle  and  aunt,  Suresh  and  Mangala,  because  they\nlived at Indravadan Society, an apartment block close to Shivaji Park. In the end, I stayed with them\nfor four years and they were hugely supportive of my endeavours and had a formative role to play as I\ngrew up. In fact, there were times when I even made my aunt throw balls to me in our living room. I\nhad bought a couple of golf balls and transformed them into an oval shape with the help of a blade. I\nhad  done  this  intentionally,  so  that  when  my  aunt  threw  one  to  me,  the  ball  would  change  direction\nafter pitching, either coming in or going away. The whole idea behind this was that, while killing time\nat  home,  I  would  learn  to  play  with  soft  hands  without  damaging  things  in  our  living  room.\nThroughout the drill, my aunt would sit on her chair, and after playing the ball I would collect it and\nhand it back to her. When my aunt wasn’t around, I would hang up the ball in a sock and hit it with the\nedge of my bat. Hitting it with the bat’s full face was much too easy and when I hit it with the edge I\nwould try to middle it as many times as possible. When it did not hit the middle, it would come back\nfrom  different  directions  (it  became  an  inswinger  or  an  outswinger)  and  it  was  fun  to  negotiate  the\nchallenge.  These  drills  helped  my  hand–eye  coordination  and  also  my  awareness  of  which  direction\nthe bat should come from to meet the ball.\nMy uncle and aunt’s house was a thirty-minute walk from school. It meant I could get more rest in\nthe morning and could come home for lunch around 1 p.m. and go back to play a practice game at my\nclub by early afternoon. Sir would invariably schedule three practice games a week for me and would\nensure that I batted at number four in each one of them. He could do that because it was his club. I\nwould  bat  in  my  favourite  position  in  all  the  matches  I  played  and  if  I  got  out  I’d  have  to  change\nquickly  and  go  out  and  field.  This  was  a  good  incentive  to  keep  batting  and  not  get  out  at  all,  as  I\ndidn’t enjoy fielding anything like as much as batting. After the match I’d resume my own training in\nthe evening before calling it a day at 7.30.\nOn days when there was a school match, we’d try our best to stretch it to a second day. For example,\nif we were set to chase 300 we’d score 260–270 runs on the first day and keep the remaining runs for\nthe next morning. This would allow us to miss school on the second day, and after quickly wrapping\nup the match in the first half an hour, the team would head off to the beach to play cricket. Playing\nbeach cricket was always a lot of fun and we would all have a great time.\nBoth my parents would visit me at my uncle and aunt’s almost every day after they finished work.\nFor my mother in particular it was an arduous journey, since travelling there from her office in Santa\nCruz in peak-hour traffic on public transport was a real challenge back then. The fact that both of them\nwould  happily  put  in  the  time  after  a  full  day’s  work,  just  so  I  would  not  feel  neglected,  was\nremarkable.\nIn  the  1986–87  season  I  started  to  make  runs  consistently  and  also  scored  my  first  hundred.  We\nwere playing Don Bosco School at Shivaji Park and I was not out on 94 at the end of the first day. A\nfew days before this match I had invited Sir to my house for dinner. Sir, however, said he would come\nonly when I had scored my first hundred in school cricket. Feeling excited and anxious, I decided to\nsleep with my father that night and kept tossing and turning till late. My father tried to comfort me,\nsaying  I  should  go  to  sleep  and  that  my  body  needed  rest  after  batting  all  day.  I  couldn’t  and  only\nmanaged to get a couple of hours’ sleep before waking up very early the next morning.\nSensing my anxiety, my father took me to a Ganapati temple in Bandra to seek the blessings of Lord\nGanesha and only then did I leave for Shivaji Park. On my way I visited another Ganapati temple, the\none I regularly visited before games. There was a water tap inside the temple premises and I regularly\nused to drink from it before I went to the ground. I did the same that day and in the very first over hit\ntwo  boundaries  to  reach  my  hundred.  True  to  his  word,  Sir  came  for  dinner  that  night  and  it  was  a\ndeeply satisfying moment.\nOne of my best early seasons was at Shardashram in 1987–88, when I played in both the Giles Shield\nand the Harris Shield. For those unfamiliar with the intricacies of Mumbai cricket, the Giles Shield is\nmeant for boys under the age of fourteen and Harris Shield for those under sixteen. Looking back, it\nseems remarkable that I played in both, but I didn’t think much of it at the time. These tournaments\nare acknowledged as breeding grounds for young talent in Mumbai and good performances tend to get\nnoticed in the city’s cricket circles.\nIn the Harris Shield that season I scored a record 1,025 runs in five matches and was out only once.\nIt now seems extraordinary, but my scores in the quarter-final, semi-final and final read 207 not out,\n326  not  out  and  346  not  out.  What’s  more,  after  scoring  326  not  out  in  the  semi-final  of  the  Harris\nShield, I walked right across the Azad maidan (recreation ground) to the other side to play in a Giles\nShield match, in which I made 178 not out, winning us the game.\nI started out with a hundred in the first match of the season, scoring 125 before getting out, and it\nwas a dismissal I have never forgotten. I was out stumped to an off-spinner who was hearing-impaired\nand  I  vividly  remember  the  expression  on  his  face  when  I  was  beaten  by  a  beautifully  flighted\ndelivery.  But  the  ball  went  on  to  elude  the  keeper  and  within  a  fraction  of  a  second  the  bowler’s\nexpression turned from euphoria to despair as he saw the missed stumping opportunity. Yet I did not\ngo back to the crease and instead started walking back to the pavilion, allowing the wicketkeeper to\ncomplete  the  stumping.  It  was  the  only  time  I  was  out  in  that  season’s  competition.  While  I  didn’t\nconsciously mean to show sympathy to the bowler, it was one of those moments that are difficult to\nexplain.  It  was  not  an  act  of  charity  exactly.  Rather,  it  was  a  good  ball  and  I  knew  I  had  been\ncomprehensively beaten. The keeper fumbled the take and the bowler looked distraught at the missed\nopportunity. He had done everything for the wicket and deserved the dismissal.\nIn the semi-final of the Harris Shield against St Xavier’s in February 1988, a three-day game, we were\n84–2  when  I  went  in  to  bat  at  number  four,  with  Vinod  Kambli,  an  extremely  talented  youngster  in\nMumbai’s  cricket  circles  at  the  time,  already  at  the  crease,  having  gone  in  at  number  three.  We\nimmediately plundered the St Xavier’s attack and never let up all the way through what would become\na  record-breaking  partnership.  With  the Azad  maidan  being  an  open  ground  and  a  very  big  one,  the\nopposition  had  to  run  long  distances  to  retrieve  the  ball  after  a  hard-hit  boundary  and  we  found\nourselves singing songs and enjoying ourselves in the middle of the pitch. It was our way of switching\noff while batting together for long periods. At the end of the day we were both not out, with Vinod on\n182 and me on 192, and, needless to say, Shardashram were in a commanding position in the game.\nThe following morning, we both made our double centuries and then just kept on batting – despite\nAchrekar  Sir  wanting  us  to  declare  the  innings.  At  one  point  he  sent  our  assistant  coach  to  the\nboundary to instruct us to declare. We could hear him scream our names and shout instructions, but\nwe pretended not to hear and tried not to look in his direction. He kept at it for ten minutes before he\nrealized  that  it  was  a  futile  attempt  and  returned  to  the  dressing  room.  We  just  wanted  to  carry  on\nbatting and enjoy ourselves in the middle.\nAt lunch we had reached 748–2, of which I had contributed 326. As soon as we left the field I was\ninformed  by  the  assistant  coach  that  I  was  in  serious  trouble.  When  I  asked  why,  he  told  me  that\nAchrekar Sir had wanted us to declare in the morning and I had disobeyed him by carrying on. Sir was\nof  the  opinion  that  we  had  more  than  enough  runs  to  declare,  and  if  we  weren’t  able  to  bowl  the\nopposition out for less we did not deserve to be in the final. I decided to declare right away to save\nmyself from Sir’s ire that evening. Vinod asked me not to, however, because he was not out on 349.\nHe pleaded with me to give him one more ball so that he’d reach 350. I said that it wasn’t my call and\nwe needed Sir’s permission to continue. So I rang Sir from a public phone next to the ground and the\nfirst question he asked was how many wickets we had managed to take before lunch. That was Sir’s\nstyle. He was well aware that we hadn’t declared and hadn’t taken any wickets, but he wouldn’t say so.\nI  informed  him  that  we  had  batted  till  lunch  and  that  I  was  about  to  declare.  With  Vinod  pleading\nbeside me, I quickly mentioned to Sir that Vinod wanted to speak to him and handed over the phone.\nBut Vinod was scared of Sir and ended up not saying a word about batting on for another over.\nI  duly  declared  the  innings  and,  despite  having  batted  for  a  day  and  a  half,  went  on  to  open  the\nbowling with the new ball and bowled a lot of overs in the innings. I did not feel the least bit tired; all\nthe hard work in the summer camps had started to pay off. I started out bowling medium pace, then\nchanged  to  off-spin  when  the  ball  was  semi-old  and  leg-spin  when  the  ball  had  lost  all  of  its  shine.\nVinod too bowled very well and picked up six wickets as we dismissed St Xavier’s for 154 to make\nthe final.\nThat partnership of 664 was the highest in any form of cricket in the world at the time. Coming in\nthe semi-final of the Harris Shield made it all the more significant in the local cricket community. It\ngained us both a lot of recognition. We had become quite a pair and what made batting with Vinod fun\nwas that I never knew what he’d get up to next. In one match in the same season he actually started\nflying a kite while we were batting together. Suddenly I couldn’t see Vinod, because he had walked 20\nmetres away from the pitch and was holding the string of a kite – right in the middle of the innings! It\nwas his way of enjoying himself and I knew he’d get a severe reprimand from Sir for doing so.\nSir  wasn’t  to  be  seen  on  that  day,  however,  and  Vinod  was  confident  of  getting  away  with  it.  I\nwasn’t so sure. I had a feeling that Sir was watching us from somewhere and would surely pick up the\nissue at the end of the day’s play, as was his style. Sir was known to hide behind a tree on occasions to\nwatch us play, and in fact it rarely happened that he’d miss a game of ours. At the end of the day he\nwould then give us a ‘demonstration’ session, so called because Sir would demonstrate what we had\ndone wrong in terms of footwork, stance or stroke selection. Sure enough, at the demonstration session\nat the end of that day, I was given a chit to read aloud and the first item was ‘Vinod kite’. Sir, upset at\nwhat Vinod had done, asked him what he thought he was doing flying a kite while batting and warned\nhim never to do so again. He promised, but with Vinod nothing could be taken for granted.\nHaving  defeated  St  Xavier’s  comprehensively,  we  were  runaway  favourites  in  the  final  against\nAnjuman-I-Islam, which was to be played at the Cricket Club of India, which is India’s equivalent of\nthe  MCC,  established  in  1933.  It  was  my  first  competitive  game  at  CCI  and  a  number  of  Mumbai\ncricket  luminaries  were  present  to  see  us  bat  in  the  final.  They  had  heard  about  the  world-record\npartnership and wanted to see if we were good enough to have a career in cricket. Dilip Vengsarkar,\nSunil  Gavaskar  and  CCI  president  Raj  Singh  Dungarpur  were  in  attendance  and  I  did  not  want  to\ndisappoint them.\nOn  the  eve  of  the  final  I  was  given  a  superb  gift  by  Hemant  Kenkre,  Sunil  Gavaskar’s  nephew,\nwhich served as an added incentive to perform well. At the time I did not have good pads to play with\nand Sir had a word with Hemant about it. Hemant had with him a set of pads used by Sunil Gavaskar,\nthe  really  light  ones  with  blue  padding  inside,  and  decided  to  give  them  to  me.  I  was  delighted  and\nhumbled and went with Ajit to his house to collect my gift.\nI felt very proud to wear pads once used by Sunil Gavaskar. I went in to bat thirty minutes before\nlunch on the first day of the final and kept batting for close to two days. I was eventually unbeaten on\n346  when  we  were  bowled  out  before  tea  on  the  third  day.  It  was  a  very  significant  innings  in  the\ncontext  of  my  career,  for  shortly  afterwards  I  was  included  in  the  list  of  Probables  for  the  Mumbai\nRanji Trophy team.\nIn  my  early  days  as  a  cricketer  another  person  who  helped  me  considerably  was  Hemant\nWaingankar. Hemant, a student of my father’s, knew me as a child and has followed my career from\nstart  to  finish.  It  was  at  Hemant’s  initiative  that  Anil  Joshi,  Vijay  Shirke  and  Sanju  Khamkar  of\nSungrace Mafatlal, a well-known Indian company, came forward to support both Vinod and me with\ncricket equipment. I am glad that our friendship, which is now close to three decades old, continues\neven today.\nMy Sir\nLooking back at these years of cricket, I must say I owe a lot to my coach Ramakant Achrekar – as\nwell as his assistants, Das Shivalkar and Laxman Chavan. Had it not been for Sir, I would not be the\ncricketer I turned out to be. He was a strict disciplinarian and did everything he could for me.\nOn  certain  days  he  would  even  drive  me  all  the  way  across  Mumbai  on  his  scooter  to  get  me  to\nmatches on time. Even though I loved cricket, there were still occasional days when playing with my\nfriends at home was such fun that I would conveniently forget I was supposed to go to the nets. If I\ndidn’t  turn  up,  Achrekar  Sir  would  jump  on  his  scooter  and  come  to  find  me  at  Sahitya  Sahawas.\nInevitably, I would be outside, engrossed in some game or other with my chums. Sir would spot me in\nthe melee and virtually drag me to our apartment. I would come up with excuses but he would have\nnone of it. He would get me to change and put on my shoes and then I’d ride pillion with him as we\nheaded off to Shivaji Park. On the drive he would tell me, ‘Don’t waste your time playing inane games\nwith these kids. Cricket is waiting for you at the nets. Practise hard and see what magic can transpire.’\nAt the time, I hated being dragged off but as I look back I feel sheepish about my actions and can only\nadmire Achrekar Sir’s farsightedness.\nSir  also  punished  me  on  one  occasion  when  trying  to  teach  me  a  very  important  lesson.\nShardashram English and Shardashram Marathi schools had made it to the finals of the Harris Shield\nand the match was to be played at the Wankhede Stadium. I was at that stage a Giles Shield player and\nhad nothing to do with the Harris Shield. Knowing that I’d want to go and watch the game, Sir had\narranged  a  practice  match  for  me  and  warned  me  not  to  miss  my  own  match  and  go  off  to  the\nWankhede. However, I disobeyed and went along to the final, not anticipating that Sir would be there.\nHe was as angry as I’d ever seen him and he said it wasn’t for me to come and watch other people\nplay, for if I practised hard enough, one day people from across the world would come and watch me\nplay.\nAchrekar Sir has undoubtedly made a significant contribution to cricket in Mumbai and India. I am\nby no means the only pupil of his to go on to represent India; others include Lalchand Rajput, Vinod\nKambli,  Pravin  Amre,  Ajit  Agarkar,  Sanjay  Bangar,  Balwinder  Sandhu,  Chandrakant  Pandit,  Paras\nMhambrey, Sameer Dighe and Ramesh Powar. Not for one moment has he been interested in financial\ngain, however. Quite the opposite, in fact – there were many occasions when he would help out those\nwho were so poor they could not even afford the few rupees normally charged for his summer school.\nThroughout my career, before each tour and each series for India, I would make four visits that were\nvery  important  to  me:  to  two  temples  in  Mumbai,  the  Ganesh  temple  in  Shivaji  Park  and  the\nSiddhivinayak temple in Prabhadevi; to my aunt and uncle; and to Achrekar Sir.\nMy short career as a fast bowler\nMy first good season for Shardashram earned me a trial place at the MRF Pace Foundation in Chennai\nin  1987  under  the  legendary  Australian  fast  bowler  Dennis  Lillee,  who  was  head  coach  there.  The\nMRF  Pace  Foundation  had  been  set  up  with  the  explicit  aim  of  grooming  local  fast-bowling  talent,\nsomething  that  we  have  always  lacked  in  India.  Coaches  from  across  India  had  been  asked  to  name\ntalented youngsters and my name was suggested by Vasu Paranjpe, veteran Mumbai cricketer and one\nof India’s best coaches. Vasu Sir has always been extremely supportive of my efforts and has been a\nkind  of  mentor  to  me.  Though  the  camp  was  primarily  meant  to  identify  talented  fast  bowlers, Ajit\nadvised me to take my full kit to Chennai. The thought was that if I wasn’t selected as a bowler I could\nbenefit  from  batting  in  the  nets  there.  Perhaps  unsurprisingly,  given  my  build  and  height,  I  didn’t\nstand out as a potential international pace bowler and Dennis Lillee jokingly advised me to focus on\nmy  batting  instead.  As  it  turned  out,  I  was  always  a  batsman  who  wanted  to  learn  the  art  of  fast\nbowling.\nThe first break\nAll the hard work under the watchful supervision of Sir finally paid off when I was picked in the squad\nto  represent  Mumbai  in  the  Ranji  Trophy  on  14  November  1987.  The  Ranji  Trophy,  the  premier\ndomestic competition in India, was started in 1933–34 and named after the famous KS Ranjitsinhji,\nIndian  cricket’s  first  global  figure,  who  played  for  England  against  Australia  in  1896.  It  is  an\nimportant platform and consistent performances in the Ranji Trophy can earn a player a national call-\nup. In the 1980s it was played on a zonal basis. First-class teams from each zone, West, North, South,\nEast and Central, played each other before the top teams advanced to the knock-out stage.\nDespite  making  the  Mumbai  squad,  I  did  not  make  it  to  the  final  XI  in  any  of  the  matches.  This\nmeant  I  narrowly  missed  out  on  playing  alongside  Sunil  Gavaskar,  who  retired  from  all  forms  of\ncricket after the 1987 Cricket World Cup, a few months before I made the Ranji squad. When I was\ngrowing up, Mr Gavaskar’s thirty-four centuries for India had always served as a huge inspiration. It\nwas  the  ultimate  benchmark  for  a  batsman,  and  not  to  have  played  alongside  him  remains  a  regret.\nHowever, that season I did get a little taste of the Ranji Trophy, as a substitute fielder – and also of\ninternational cricket, while fielding at the Brabourne Stadium for a Pakistan team against India!\nIt  was  a  festival  match  and  two  Pakistan  cricketers,  Javed  Miandad  and  leg-spinner Abdul  Qadir,\nhad  gone  off  the  field  at  lunchtime.  I  was  asked  to  substitute  and  was  deployed  at  wide  long  on  by\nskipper Imran Khan. Within minutes Kapil Dev hit a skier and, despite running in 15 metres, I wasn’t\nable to reach the ball. I remember complaining to my friend Marcus Couto that evening on the train\nhome that I could have taken the catch if I had been positioned at mid on instead of long on. I don’t\nknow whether Imran Khan remembers the occasion or has any idea that I once fielded for his Pakistan\nteam.\nOne incident I remember from my Ranji Trophy debut season took place when we played in Baroda\nin one of the West Zone encounters. I was just fourteen then and was sharing a room with Suru Nayak,\na former India international. The team had reached Baroda a few days in advance and on one of the\ndays  we  had  dinner  a  little  earlier  than  normal.  Afterwards  Suru  Nayak  asked  me  to  go  to  bed,\nsuggesting  that  I  should  take  some  rest  while  the  other  players  went  out  to  offer  pujas  at  the  local\ntemple. I had no reason to disbelieve him and went off to sleep in my room. Only later did I find out\nthat  the  other  players  had  gone  out  partying  at  night  and  because  I  was  only  fourteen  I  had  been\nconveniently left out.\nI wasn’t always so well behaved, of course. In 1987 I remember playing for the Mumbai Under-15\nteam at Cuttack in Eastern India. We were staying in a college dormitory and there were fifteen beds\naligned in a row. Next to the dorm was a balcony and beyond it lay the college sports field. Two of my\nfriends in the team were Jatin Paranjpe (who went on to play one-day international cricket for India)\nand  Vinod  Kambli,  and  together  we  had  planned  that  after  lights-out  we  would  sneak  around  and\ngather  up  all  the  other  players’  shoes,  including  their  spikes.  With  the  dorm  pitch-dark,  we  started\nthrowing them at Kedar Godbole, one of our hapless team-mates. Other players were also in our line\nof fire and before they could figure out what was going on they were hit by a barrage of shoe missiles.\nWhen they started throwing them back at us, we ducked and their shoes flew over our heads and over\nthe balcony into the adjoining field. Finally, at two in the morning, the whole team was down on the\nground looking for their shoes and chappals!\nRanji Trophy debut\nThe following year, I was watched closely by Mumbai captain Dilip Vengsarkar in the Cricket Club of\nIndia  nets  when  the  Indian  team  came  to  play  a  match  against  the  touring  New  Zealand  team.\nVengsarkar  was  impressed  with  the  way  I  played  against  Kapil  Dev  and  sometime  later,  on  10\nDecember 1988, when I was fifteen, he told the selectors that I was ready to play for Mumbai against\nGujarat, giving me my first big break. Vengsarkar himself was busy with national duty and I filled in\nfor  him.  In  my  debut  match  I  scored  100  not  out  and  in  the  process  became  the  youngest  Indian  to\nscore a century on his first-class debut. I finished the 1988–89 season as Mumbai’s highest run-scorer\nand made half-centuries in six of the seven matches I played. Mumbai lost a hard-fought semi-final\nagainst Delhi and I ended my debut season with a respectable batting average of 64.77. In the semi-\nfinal, Madan Lal, former India fast bowler and coach, was playing for Delhi and I remember playing a\nstraight  drive  to  him  that  was  much  talked  about  that  evening.  It  was  a  shot  that  got  me  noticed,\nadding to my stock at the time. Everything about the shot was perfect – balance, head position, timing\n– and the ball raced to the boundary.\nMy  performances  for  Mumbai  got  me  selected  for  the  season-opening  Irani  Trophy  match  at  the\nbeginning of November 1989. The Irani Trophy, between the Ranji Trophy champions and the Rest of\nIndia, is a key component of the Indian domestic cricket calendar and is a major opportunity to get\nnoticed. Playing for the Rest of India, I scored a hundred against Ranji champions Delhi in my first\nIrani Trophy game and it was during this match that the Indian touring team for the much-awaited tour\nto Pakistan in November–December 1989 was announced.\nBefore I knew it, at sixteen years of age, I had been picked to play for India.\n"

            "title": "MY FIRST TOUR\n",
            "data": "I had always dreamed of playing cricket for India. Getting an opportunity to fulfil my dream at such\nan early age was indeed very special. What made it even more significant was that we were playing\nPakistan  in  Pakistan  and  their  bowling  attack  included  fast  bowlers  of  the  quality  of  Imran  Khan,\nWasim Akram, Waqar Younis and Aaqib Javed, not to mention the leg-spinners Mushtaq Ahmed and\nAbdul Qadir – quite a test for any debutant.\nIt was baptism by fire. So much so that after my very first innings in Test cricket, during which I\nwas all at sea against Wasim and Waqar, I began to doubt my ability to bat and questioned whether I\nwas ever going to be good enough to play at international level.\nBefore describing my debut series, I want to go back to that first Irani Trophy game for the Rest of\nIndia  against  Delhi.  I  had  scored  39  in  the  first  innings  before  I  was  bowled  by  Maninder  Singh,\nIndia’s ace left-arm spinner at the time. The disappointment did not last long, however, because it was\nthat evening when I learned I had been named in the Indian squad for the Pakistan tour. Ecstatic at my\ninclusion, I was determined to make a mark in the second innings.\nThe occasion was particularly special because my brother had come to see me play. In fact, since I\nwas a minor and could not sign the tour contract, Ajit had to sign it on my behalf. Vasu Paranjpe had\nalso mentioned to my father that morning that I would surely get a hundred and said that he should\ncome and watch me bat. My father did just that and, to his satisfaction, what Vasu Sir had predicted\ncame  true.  However,  the  century  would  not  have  happened  but  for  the  contribution  of  Gursharan\nSingh, the Punjab batsman who later played a Test match for India against New Zealand in 1990.\nGursharan had fractured his finger while batting against the bowling of Atul Wassan, a Delhi fast\nbowler who also made his debut for India against New Zealand in 1990. He was sitting in the dressing\nroom injured and there seemed to be no way he could play a further part in the match. I was batting\nwell  and  was  unbeaten  on  86  when  our  ninth  wicket  fell.  Knowing  that  Gursharan  couldn’t  bat,  I\nstarted  walking  back  to  the  dressing  room,  assuming  it  was  the  end  of  our  innings.  Just  then  I  saw\nGursharan walking towards me, ready to bat one-handed.\nIt  was  later  revealed  to  me  that  Raj  Singh  Dungarpur,  then  chairman  of  the  national  selection\ncommittee,  had  asked  if  he  would  go  out  and  help  me  get  to  my  hundred.  In  an  exemplary  show  of\ncourage, Gursharan had agreed. In fact, when we met at the wicket I felt distinctly embarrassed seeing\nhim there in such severe pain. I told him that it would be perfectly understandable if we called off the\ninnings. Showing tremendous grit, he told me, ‘Ab to tera hundred kar ke hi jayenge.’ (I will get back\nto the pavilion only after you get your hundred.) He doggedly stuck to his task, and I’m glad to say\nthat his bravery was respected by the opposition bowlers, who did not resort to bowling bouncers.\nIt  was  a  favour  I  would  never  forget.  It  was  a  show  of  remarkable  resilience  by  Gursharan  and  I\ntried to repay the debt by doing what I could at the time of his benefit match in Delhi in April 2005. I\nhad promised him that as long as he gave me a few days’ notice, I’d turn up to play, no matter where I\nwas. I am glad I was able to keep my promise.\nIndia in Pakistan, November–December 1989\nEncouraged  at  having  got  a  hundred  against  India’s  domestic  champions,  I  headed  to  Pakistan  soon\nafter  feeling  reasonably  confident.  Maybe  because  I  was  still  a  teenager,  I  didn’t  feel  any  extra\npressure about playing against Pakistan. The whole political baggage of India–Pakistan cricket meant\nnothing to me. I was simply treating it as my first tour, which was challenge enough. In any case, no\none really expected me to be a part of the playing XI at such a young age, certainly not in any of the\nTests.  Some  thought  I  might  get  a  chance  in  one  of  the  one-day  games,  depending  on  the  team’s\nperformance in the series, while others believed I was there only to get a feel of international cricket.\nTo be honest, all the talk passed me by. I just wanted to do well for India and score a lot of runs.\nOther than that, everything else seemed unimportant. That was natural enough, because everything had\nhappened rather quickly in my life. Just five years after I took to playing competitive cricket, I had\nbecome a part of the Indian squad – it was a pretty quick move from school to international cricket.\nOn arrival in Pakistan I didn’t sense any tension and went out for regular meals in the evening with\nsome  of  the  other  cricketers.  Their  friendly  approach  helped  put  me  at  ease  and  it  was  not  until  we\nreached Lahore that a curfew was imposed on going out in the evenings. On my travels around India I\nhad always bought gifts such as sarees for my mother and aunt and shirts for my father and uncle, and\nso  in  the  first  few  days  in  Pakistan  I  did  the  same.  This  time  I  bought  them  some  local  shoes  and\nslippers.\nThere was tension within the squad, however, as a result of a dispute that had blown up before the\ntour  between  the  Board  of  Control  for  Cricket  in  India  (BCCI)  and  the  players  over  the  issue  of\nplayers’  involvement  in  a  few  unsanctioned  matches  in  the  United  States  on  the  way  back  from  the\nWest  Indies  tour  in  1988.  The  matter  had  gone  right  up  to  the  Indian  Supreme  Court  and  was\neventually  settled  when  the  court  lifted  a  ban  imposed  on  the  players  by  the  BCCI.  The  other\ncontroversy that arose on the eve of the tour was over the issue of match fees. It had escalated into a\nserious  dispute,  with  the  players  opting  to  give  up  their  match  fees  altogether  as  a  mark  of  protest.\nFortunately for the junior players in the team, skipper Krishnamachari Srikkanth instructed us to stay\naway from the problems and concentrate on the job at hand, which was to evolve a strategy to tackle\nImran, Wasim, Waqar and Abdul Qadir.\nI had a good start to the tour and in one of the two games before the first Test, against the Pakistan\nBoard Patron’s XI in Rawalpindi, scored 47 before getting out to Iqbal Qasim, a left-arm spinner who\nplayed for Pakistan in fifty Tests. It was a decent innings and I received a standing ovation from the\ncrowd. I began to feel I had a slim chance of getting into the Test team and dared to dream of my first\nTest  cap.  I  finally  heard  the  news  of  my  inclusion  in  the  playing  XI  from  skipper  Srikkanth  on  the\nnight before the first Test in Karachi.\nIt is very difficult to describe the feeling. I was part of a band of eleven fortunate men who had been\ngiven  the  duty  of  representing  close  to  a  billion  Indians.  It  was  an  honour  every  aspiring  cricketer\nlives  for,  to  play  for  his  country  against  the  best  of  world  cricket.  And  with  the  honour  came\nresponsibility. I was going to be accountable to the cricket fans back home and was expected to give\nmy best for them. In fact, I could imagine nothing more significant than doing something worthy for\nthe national team and the passionate Indian cricket fans.\nI was sharing a room with Salil Ankola, the fast bowler who has now gone on to become an actor.\nSalil was bowling well at the time and was also making his Test debut. Neither of us could sleep the\nnight  before  the  match.  We  were  both  about  to  start  a  new  chapter  and  were  aware  that  it  was  an\nopportunity that could change our lives for ever.\nFirst Test, Karachi, 15–20 November 1989\nPakistan won the toss and opted to bat first on a greenish wicket so I didn’t have long to wait to walk\nonto the field for the first time as an India player. My life had taken a giant leap and it is a moment I\nwill always remember. It also happened to be Kapil Dev’s 100th Test match and we were all excited\nfor him. Only Sunil Gavaskar and Dilip Vengsarkar had achieved the distinction before.\nMy  first  day  of  international  cricket  wasn’t  without  drama  and  one  incident  in  particular  left  an\nunpleasant feeling. In the post-lunch session a bearded man clad in salwar kameez entered the field\nand  went  straight  up  to  Kapil  Dev,  abusing  him  for  being  in  Pakistan.  Kapil,  who  was  preparing  to\nbowl at the time, later recounted to us that he asked the fellow to leave him alone and allow him to\ncontinue with the game. After his exchange with Kapil, the intruder then went over to mid off, where\nManoj Prabhakar, our top fast bowler on the tour, was fielding. He abused Prabhakar before moving\non  to  skipper  Srikkanth  –  and  with  Srikkanth  he  got  physical.  In  those  days,  with  the  sport  far  less\ncommercialized,  players  could  choose  what  kit  to  wear.  Most  of  our  team  preferred  T-shirts,  but\nSrikkanth liked to wear a buttoned shirt and this was torn open in the scuffle.\nI was fielding at point and I was scared I would be next and was ready to run to the safe confines of\nthe dressing room if the intruder came towards me. Up to this point, no security personnel had done\nanything to stop the intruder from disrupting things in the middle. It was only when the Indian captain\nwas being manhandled that security finally came onto the ground to drag the spectator off. It was a\nserious security lapse, yet the organizers seemed hardly perturbed. The truth is that it was much more\nthan a cricket match that was being played between the two teams. The political history of partition\nhas always cast a pall over India–Pakistan cricket and it was my first taste of this unfortunate reality.\nThe next day we were even more astonished to find the Pakistan press suggesting that the intruder had\nactually  been  trying  to  congratulate  Kapil  Dev  on  playing  his  100th  Test  match.  The  issue  of\nSrikkanth’s torn shirt didn’t merit a mention by the local media.\nAll at sea\nOn the second day of the match, Pakistan were all out for 409, with skipper Imran Khan scoring 109\nnot out. Finally, it was our turn to bat. The pitch was lively and we didn’t get off to a good start. We\nwere soon reduced to 41–4, with Srikkanth, Navjot Sidhu, Sanjay Manjrekar and Manoj Prabhakar out\ncheaply.  Wasim  and  Waqar  were  bowling  really  fast  and  it  was  a  trying  time  for  every  Indian\nbatsman.  I  hadn’t  quite  anticipated  what  awaited  me  out  in  the  middle  when  I  went  out  to  bat  at\nnumber six. There’s no harm in admitting that I was all at sea against Wasim and Waqar in my first\ninnings  in  Test  cricket.  I  was  trying  to  be  aggressive  to  almost  every  ball,  as  that  was  how  I  had\nalways  played  the  game.  I  was  trying  to  get  on  top  of  the  bowlers,  but  more  often  than  not  I  was\ncomprehensively beaten. The pace was far greater than I had ever faced and the skill on display was of\nthe very highest standard. The guile of both bowlers left me thoroughly confused.\nAn account of one Wasim over will give an idea of my plight in the middle. I was on strike to him\nfor  the  third  ball  of  the  over,  which  turned  out  to  be  a  vicious  bouncer.  Having  studied  Wasim’s\nbowling, I was convinced the next ball would be a yorker and was mentally prepared for it. It turned\nout to be another bouncer, which I left. While I kept expecting a fiery yorker, balls five and six also\nturned out to be bouncers, and at the end of the over I said to myself, ‘Welcome to Test cricket.’ Not\nwithout reason is it acknowledged as the most challenging format of the game.\nMy stay at the crease was short and not sweet. I had lasted only twenty-four balls, at least half of\nwhich I had missed. I had hit two boundaries but not for a moment had I felt comfortable. It was only\na  matter  of  time  before  I  was  dismissed.  I  was  finally  bowled  for  a  rather  lucky  15  by  another\ndebutant, Waqar Younis, and on my way back to the pavilion my mind was riddled with self-doubt.\nIt was a very important moment in my career. I had come to the international stage after blazing my\nway  through  domestic  cricket.  I  had  managed  to  score  a  hundred  on  debut  in  the  Ranji  and  Irani\ntrophies, but here I was on the international stage unable to put bat on ball. I was struggling, plain and\nsimple. The difference in standard between domestic and international cricket was colossal.\nI  batted  only  once  in  that  first  Test  match,  which  ended  in  a  draw,  and  in  the  following  days  I\napproached our coach, Chandu Borde, and a number of senior team-mates to discuss what I needed to\ndo to improve. I had a long chat with Ravi Shastri, already an established star at the time, who advised\nme to be patient for the first fifteen or twenty minutes, which were bound to be uncomfortable. Ravi\nwas of the opinion that once I had played out the initial burst from the Pakistani bowlers, things would\nturn easier. The key was to spend time in the middle. But would I be given another opportunity to do\nso? I could easily have missed out on the second Test, not only because of my low score in the first\nbut also because of the way I had batted.\nIt came as a huge relief to see my name in the playing XI for the second Test at Faisalabad.\nSecond Test, Faisalabad, 23–28 November 1989\nI  knew  it  was  a  chance  I  could  not  afford  to  squander;  it  would  be  a  big  test  of  my  ability  and\ntemperament.  What  made  the  task  considerably  more  difficult  was  that  Pakistan  won  the  toss  on  a\ngreen-top  and  put  India  in  to  bat.  The  stage  was  set.  All  through  my  career  I  have  relished  these\nmoments  of  adversity.  It  is  no  good  just  performing  on  a  docile  track  against  weak  opposition.  A\ncricketer  gets  true  satisfaction  only  if  he  is  able  to  perform  in  difficult  conditions  against  the  best\nbowlers.\nOnce again we lost early wickets and I went in to bat with four top-order wickets down for 101. This\ntime around, although it really wasn’t my style then, I forced myself to stay at the wicket for the first\nfifteen minutes to get used to the conditions. I have no qualms about confessing that it was difficult.\nThe bowlers were definitely on top at the start of my innings, but with time things turned easier. I was\nable to adjust to the pace and bounce of the wicket, and my confidence was gradually coming back.\nI  managed  to  play  172  balls  en  route  to  my  first  half-century  in  Test  cricket  and  was  finally\ndismissed by Imran for 59. I was involved in a 143-run partnership with Sanjay Manjrekar and though\nI hit only four boundaries, the innings gave me a lot of satisfaction. It also taught me a good lesson:\nthere  was  no  point  in  trying  to  blaze  my  way  through  every  innings.  Most  importantly,  this  knock\nconvinced me that I could actually cope with international cricket, though I knew I still had a lot to\nlearn.  In  the  second  innings  I  ran  myself  out  for  eight,  sacrificing  my  wicket  for  Mohammad\nAzharuddin, who was nearing a well-deserved hundred. In the end, we managed to thwart a Pakistan\nvictory. After  two  Tests  the  series  was  still  drawn  and  it  was  evident  that  Pakistan  were  feeling  the\npressure. Many had predicted a 4–0 scoreline in their favour and it was starting to play on their minds.\nThird Test, Lahore, 1–6 December 1989\nFrom  Faisalabad  we  moved  to  Lahore  for  the  third  Test.  Unable  to  venture  out  of  the  hotel  in  the\nevenings,  the  players  and  the  touring  Indian  media  were  feeling  a  little  restless  and  this  called  for\nsome original thinking. For the first and only time in my career the media and the players got together\nfor  what  was  decreed  a  ‘Sunday  Club’.  It  was  to  be  an  evening  of  stories,  music,  food  and  fun  and\neveryone had to wear something fancy. It turned out to be a very successful experiment, but sadly it\nhasn’t been repeated since. It definitely helped to create a bond between the team and the media, so\nnecessary during an arduous away tour.\nI wore a blue pullover to the Sunday Club and that’s where the often published picture of me with a\nthick moustache, Aussie fast bowler Merv Hughes-style, was taken. The food served that evening was\nunbelievable. Lahore is a foodie’s delight and I wolfed down all the delectable kebabs on offer and I\nloved  the haleem (a stew of meat and lentils). In fact, I had a voracious appetite throughout the tour.\nMy body was still growing and I ate huge amounts. On non-match days I used to eat keema  parathas\n(mincemeat parathas) and lassi (yogurt drink) for breakfast and by the time I went back to India I had\nput on a few kilos and had also grown much stronger.\nThe  Lahore  Test  was  local  hero  Javed  Miandad’s  100th  and  in  a  change  from  the  first  two  Test\nmatches  in  Karachi  and  Faisalabad,  we  were  faced  with  the  flattest  of  batting  decks,  which  had\nobviously been prepared to help Javed score a hundred, which he duly did. Even after five days, the\nfirst innings of both teams had still not been completed.\nAt  the  start  of  my  innings  in  Lahore  I  misjudged  the  bounce  of  a  straight  delivery  from  Imran,\nwhich  hit  me  on  my  biceps.  I  was  furious  at  allowing  myself  to  be  hit  on  a  flat  pitch.  The  point  of\nimpact instantly turned numb and my first instinct was to step out and dispatch the very next ball over\nthe boundary. However, the lesson learnt at Faisalabad came to my rescue and I reined myself in.\nI had worked my way to 41 off ninety balls when I tried to play an on drive to Abdul Qadir and was\nbowled. I had been batting well and I regret not going on to play a long innings. It was an opportunity\nmissed. It has to be said, though, that the match, a tame draw, was not the best advertisement for Test\ncricket.\nSweet dreams\nThe  fourth  and  final  Test  of  the  series  was  at  Sialkot  and  we  knew  that  we’d  be  given  a  green-top,\nwhich  offered  Pakistan’s  best  chance  to  take  the  series.  By  now  they  were  desperate  to  win;  a  draw\nwould have been considered a series defeat for Imran and his team. When we arrived at Sialkot, I was\ninvited to the MB Malik bat-manufacturing company. Sialkot has quite a tradition of bat-making in\nPakistan and at the time I didn’t have a contract for my bats and could pick up any bat and play. I went\nto the factory with a few of the other players and chose two or three bats for myself.\nI was so excited about my new bats that I even dreamed about them one night. Apparently, it was\naround midnight and I walked straight out of my room asking for my bats. Maninder Singh and Raman\nLamba saw me advancing down the corridor and said to me, ‘Tere bats to tere pass hi hai. ’ (Your bats\nare with you only.) When I didn’t respond, they realized that I was sleepwalking. They helped me back\ninto the room and put me back to bed. By that stage of the tour, Raman and I had struck up a good\nfriendship and spent many hours together discussing the nuances of batting. He was fun to be with and\nit was absolutely tragic that he died after being struck on his head by a ball while fielding during a\nfirst-class match in Dhaka in 1998.\nFourth Test, Sialkot, 9–14 December 1989\nWhat made the Sialkot Test special was that my brother Ajit had travelled to see me play. It was an\nadded incentive to do well and both Ajit and I still remember the kindness the locals bestowed on him\nthe moment they became aware that he was from India and had come to watch cricket.\nAs expected, the wicket was green, but the December weather was also heavy, resulting in a lot of\nearly-morning fog. So much so that play never started on time and it ended early each afternoon. This\nmeant the four Pakistani fast bowlers could come at us all day, hoping to roll us over and secure the\nupper hand. In the first innings I played pretty well for my 35 and was feeling good before falling lbw\nto Wasim. I wasn’t so uncomfortable at the start of my innings and the initial apprehension was no\nlonger an issue. I hit some pleasing shots and scored at a good clip in the course of my 51-ball stay at\nthe wicket.\nIndia managed a 74-run first-innings lead, with Vivek Razdan, a fast bowler who played two Tests\nfor  India,  picking  up  5–79  in  the  Pakistan  first  innings.  We  had  bowled  them  out  for  250  and\nunderstandably Pakistan came back at us hard at the start of our second innings. We lost a cluster of\nearly wickets and I went in to bat at 38–4, with a day and a half still to go in the match.\nWaqar was bowling from one end and it was absolutely essential to survive the initial burst. I had\njust scored my first run when Waqar bowled a short delivery, which I expected would rise chin-high. I\nmisjudged the bounce of the ball. It rose six inches higher than expected and hit me on the flap of my\nhelmet before deflecting and hitting my nose. At the time I was the only batsman besides Srikkanth\nnot to wear a grille. It wasn’t an act of bravado; I just wasn’t used to playing with one. Ajit, who was\nsitting right in front of the Indian dressing room, later said to me that he had clearly heard the sound\nof the ball hitting my helmet and deflecting on to my nose.\nMy vision was blurred and my head felt heavy. After impact, the ball went towards the slips and my\nnatural movement was to see where the ball had gone. It was then that I noticed all the blood spattered\non my shirt. As I was trying to recover from the blow, I was amused by Javed Miandad’s comments.\nIn an attempt to psych me out, he was saying things like ‘Arre tujhe to abhi hospital jana parega; tera\nnaak  tut  gaya  hai.’  (You  may  have  to  go  to  the  hospital;  your  nose  is  broken.)  To  add  to  my\ndiscomfort, a banner in the stands read, ‘Bachhe ghar ja ke dudh pie kea aa.’ (Kid go home and drink\nmilk.)\nI ignored all this while our team doctor, Vishwas Raut, inspected the injury. He put some ice on my\nnose and asked if I wanted to go off. I did not, for I considered it a moment of reckoning. Going off\nwould  suggest  I  was  scared. And  truly  I  wasn’t.  It  wasn’t  the  first  time  I  had  been  hit,  though  the\nimpact  was  much  more  severe  than  anything  I  had  suffered  before.  I  decided  to  carry  on  and  said,\n‘Main khelega.’ (I will play.) It was important for my own self-esteem, and by staying in I felt I had\nmade a statement to the opposition.\nSeeing  me  continue,  Imran  asked  Javed  to  move  away  and  all  the  Pakistani  players  went  back  to\ntheir respective field positions. Soon after the resumption, I got a full ball from Waqar on my legs and\nflicked it to the boundary. I followed it up with a drive on the off side and felt genuinely good about\nmyself. I had treated the balls on merit and wasn’t just being aggressive to avenge being hit. Soon it\nwas time for tea and I had an opportunity to regroup. After the break I started to bat really well. I was\nfeeling  confident  and  was  determined  not  to  give  my  wicket  away.  Importantly  for  the  team,  I\nmanaged to play out the day and we were on course to force a draw.\nShortly after going back to the hotel, however, I felt heavy in the head. We had a team function in\nthe evening but I asked permission from manager Chandu Borde and went to bed early after taking a\nfew painkillers and having dinner with Ajit and Navjot Sidhu, which helped me calm down. When I\ngot up the next morning after a good night’s sleep, I was feeling ready for the challenge of the final\nday. We were on 102–4 overnight and needed to spend at least two more hours at the crease to deny\nPakistan any opportunity of winning the Test.\nNavjot Sidhu and I held out until I was dismissed by Imran for 57. It was my second half-century in\nTest cricket. Denying Pakistan a win on home turf was a big achievement for India, especially with the\nkind of bowling attack they had, and it served as a major confidence boost for the team. We were all\nelated at the performance.\nThe Abdul Qadir over\nAfter the Tests, we played a five-match one-day series in which none of the matches was played for\nthe scheduled fifty overs. While some of them were affected by rain, the third match was abandoned\nbecause of crowd trouble after Pakistan had been reduced to 29–3 by some good swing bowling from\nManoj Prabhakar. The first match was due to be played in Peshawar on 16 December 1989 and had to\nbe  called  off  at  the  last  moment  because  of  rain.  However,  a  large  crowd  had  braved  the  inclement\nweather  and  it  was  finally  agreed  between  both  teams  that  a  twenty-over-a-side  exhibition  game,\nperhaps the first ever Twenty20 game, would be played for the sake of the crowd. It was a good call,\nas the fans deserved to be given their money’s worth. They are the ones who make the game what it is,\nafter all, and they are pivotal to its health around the world.\nMost people will agree that even an exhibition game between India and Pakistan can’t help being a\nserious cricket match. At Peshawar Pakistan had scored 157 in their innings, and when I went in to bat\nwith  three  wickets  down,  the  asking  rate  had  climbed  to  well  past  11  runs  an  over.  Srikkanth  was\nbatting with me and suggested we should dig in and get some practice for the following games. I was\ndetermined to go for the bowling and felt we still had a chance to make a match of it if we played our\nshots. That’s what I suggested to Srikkanth and while he was a tad surprised, he told me to play the\nway I was comfortable with.\nMushtaq Ahmed, an up-and-coming Pakistani leg-spinner at that stage, was bowling and I hit him\nfor a couple of sixes and a boundary in the first over I faced. While both sixes were hit over long on,\nthe second went a fair distance and hit the dressing-room window, breaking the glass. The Pakistanis\nhadn’t expected me to hit it so far and Abdul Qadir, an experienced old hand at the time, walked up to\nme  and  said, ‘Bachhe  ko  kyun  mar  rahe  ho;  dum  hai  to  mujhe  mar  ke  dikhao.’  (No  point  in  hitting\nsixes off a newcomer; if you have the skills, try and hit me.) I said to him that he was a great bowler\nand that I was sure he wouldn’t allow me to hit him.\nWith just two overs left we needed more than 40 runs and Qadir was to bowl the penultimate over.\nOur only chance was to attack. I had made up my mind that if the ball was in my zone I’d go for my\nshots. As it happened, most of the balls were in my hitting arc and I took 28 off the over. I hit the first\nball for six over long on and followed it up with a four off the third ball. The fourth ball resulted in a\nsecond six, which I hit straight over the bowler’s head. Seeing me hit straight, Qadir bowled the fifth\nball wide outside off stump in an attempt to get me stumped. I had anticipated the move and hit the\nball over long off for the third six of the over. For the last ball he went even further outside off stump\nand I stretched out to hit the ball wide over long off, to make it four sixes in the over.\nThe crowd, which had been confident of a Pakistan victory till an over earlier, was roused by this\nunexpected  turn  of  events  and  started  making  a  lot  of  noise.  There  was  a  sudden  increase  in  energy\nlevels  at  the  ground.  The  match  was  now  being  played  in  full  seriousness  and  no  one  really  knew\nwhich team would win. We needed 14 runs off the last over, bowled by Wasim Akram. Eventually we\nfell short by three runs. Straight after the match, Abdul Qadir walked up to me in true sportsmanlike\nmanner and said ‘Bahut ala batting.’ (Very well batted.)\nThat innings of 53 off eighteen balls at Peshawar had a defining impact on my career. In the eyes of\nthe  public,  it  had  overshadowed  my  effort  at  Sialkot,  which  was  far  more  difficult  and  far  more\nsignificant as far as I was concerned. The Sialkot innings had allowed us to save the Test match and\nalso the series. But for people at home the innings at Peshawar was the real talking point. It had given\nme instant recognition and made me a household name. For the first time I was asked for autographs,\nwhich was a strange feeling. Before we went to Pakistan I had been able to go out with my friends and\nhave bhel  (a  type  of  fast  food  loved  all  over  Mumbai)  and  do  all  those  normal  things. Afterwards,\nwhen I went out with my friends, people would come up and ask if I was Sachin Tendulkar. And it was\nall  down  to  that  one  innings  at  Peshawar.  While  it  would  have  been  premature  to  suggest  I  had\nestablished myself at international level, it had certainly given me a toehold.\nWhen I got home, I could tell that my parents were proud of my achievements, but there has never\nbeen any over-the-top celebration in my house. While I knew that my father was extremely happy and\nsatisfied,  he  wouldn’t  ever  show  off  his  emotions  in  an  extravagant  manner.  When  I  did  well,  my\nmother  would  always  light  a diya  (a  kind  of  candle)  and  offer  sweets  to  God,  but  that’s  as  far  as  it\nwent. Sometimes people are kind enough to compliment me on my off-the-field behaviour more than\nmy on-field performance. They say that I seem to have managed to keep my feet grounded. If that’s\ntrue, then I have no hesitation in saying that all the credit goes to my family.\nAjit’s presence in Pakistan was a great help and we talked every evening about my game and how I\ncould improve. While there were many senior team-mates who I could go to, I was most comfortable\ndiscussing things with Ajit, as he knew my game better than anyone. He had watched me grow up as a\ncricketer and it was natural that his observations would always be pertinent.\nAfter  coming  back  from  Pakistan,  I  felt  much  more  positive  about  myself  as  a  cricketer  and  was\nlooking forward to India’s next away tour, to New Zealand at the start of 1990. I was pretty confident\nof  getting  picked  but  was  still  delighted  to  see  myself  in  the  squad  when  the  touring  side  was\nannounced.\nIndia in Pakistan 1989\n1st Test.

            "title": "FOREIGN CONDITIONS\n",
            "data": "New Zealand has always been a very difficult tour for an Indian cricketer. It’s often windy and chilly\nand  that,  coupled  with  the  short  boundaries  in  most  of  the  grounds,  makes  it  very  different  from\nconditions back home in India. In 1990 the challenge was doubly difficult, with Richard Hadlee, one\nof the finest ever exponents of swing bowling, close to his best. As a seventeen-year-old on his first\ntour away from the subcontinent, I was excited about the opportunity.\nIndia in New Zealand, February–March 1990\nThe first few days in New Zealand were not easy. The accent of the locals there was very strange to\nour ears and the food took some getting used to. The accent problem resulted in an incident involving\nManoj  Prabhakar  very  early  in  the  tour.  Prabhakar  needed  an  adapter  to  charge  his  gadgets  and  for\nsome  reason  decided  to  put  on  what  he  thought  was  a  New  Zealand  accent  while  speaking  to  the\nhousekeeping staff in the hotel. When asking for the adapter on the intercom he was almost chewing\nup  the  first  ‘a’,  as  a  result  of  which  the  word  was  sounding  like  ‘dapter’  and  the  staff  were  having\ndifficulty understanding what he was asking for. Prabhakar got angry after a point and said he needed\nthe ‘dapter’ immediately. In a few minutes there was a knock on his door and he opened it to find a\ndoctor  standing  there.  The  staff  had  heard  ‘doctor’  for  ‘dapter’  (partly  because  they  pronounced\n‘doctor’ as ‘dactor’) and had sent the resident physician to Prabhakar’s room.\nThe first game of the tour was in New Plymouth and the ground was surrounded by hills. It was as if\na stadium had been planted in the middle of mountains and Bishan Singh Bedi, our manager, decided\nto make the most of the conditions. Bedi, one of the best left-arm spinners of all time, was a really\nhard taskmaster and liked to make us run huge distances to improve our fitness. At New Plymouth our\nfitness  drills  involved  running  in  the  mountains  and  by  the  end  of  the  training  sessions  we  had\nabsolutely no energy left.\nAs in Pakistan, I did not start particularly well and in the first Test at Christchurch, which started on\n2  February,  I  was  dismissed  by  Danny  Morrison  for  a  golden  duck.  It  was  a  good  delivery  but  the\nsend-off was interesting, to say the least. I could hear most of the New Zealand players calling me a\nschoolboy,  with  plenty  of  F-words  thrown  in.  They  kindly  advised  me  to  go  back  to  playing  cricket\nwith my school chums, suggesting that I wasn’t fit to compete at international level. I kept my mouth\nshut.\nThe second innings was an improvement in that I managed to stay at the wicket for close to an hour,\nplaying forty-four balls. My 24 runs were enough to give me confidence that I was capable of holding\nmy own in strange conditions. Although I had fallen to John Bracewell, trying to cut a ball close to my\nbody, I had successfully negotiated Richard Hadlee, which I counted as an achievement. Hadlee’s first\ntwo deliveries to me were bouncers, but each was profoundly different from the other. The first was an\noutswinging bouncer that went away after pitching; the second came in from the same spot and I had\nto keep my eye on the ball till the last moment to get my head out of the way. Such was the ability of\nthe man that you had to be at your best at all times to keep him at bay.\nNew Zealand won the first Test by ten wickets and the second Test match at Napier started only a\nfew  days  later,  on  9  February.  We  decided  to  bat  first  after  winning  the  toss  but  the  first  day  was\ncompletely washed out by rain. The match finally started on the second day and I was unbeaten on 80\nby the end of the third day’s play. The ball was doing a little and batting wasn’t particularly easy, but\nnot once did I try to dominate the bowling the way I had in domestic cricket.\nWhen I went in to bat on the fourth morning the possibility of a hundred was on my mind. I was just\n20 runs short and was determined to take my opportunity. I started well and hit the very first Danny\nMorrison  delivery  for  four.  For  the  rest  of  the  over  he  bowled  short  and  I  was  content  to  leave\neverything. In his next over, I again hit a boundary off the first ball. The next was pitched up and I had\nalready made up my mind to go for a big drive but the drive was uppish and I was caught by the New\nZealand captain John Wright at mid off for 88.\nI was heartbroken. As I walked back to the pavilion I couldn’t control my tears. Why on earth did I\nplay that shot when I was just twelve runs short? By the time I reached the boundary rope, tears were\nflowing down my cheeks. I’m glad there weren’t too many cameras then, as these days a cameraman\nwould definitely have picked up an embarrassing shot of me in tears. On reaching the dressing room, I\nwent straight to the bathroom and cried for a good few minutes. Missing out on what should have been\nmy  first  Test  hundred  was  just  too  painful.  It  was  only  later  that  I  was  told  I  would  have  been  the\nyoungest Test centurion ever. It was a missed opportunity and I remember telling John Wright, after\nhe took over as coach of India in 2005, that he really shouldn’t have taken that catch!\nWe eventually lost the three-Test match series 0–1 and then played the Rothmans Cup one-day tri-\nseries,  with Australia  as  the  third  team. As  in  the  first  Test,  I  was  out  for  a  duck  in  the  first  ODI\nagainst New Zealand at Dunedin on 1 March, caught and bowled by Shane Thomson, who was bowling\nmedium pace. The only difference was that this time I had lasted one more ball. In the end, we lost the\ngame by 108 runs.\nI made a better fist of it in my next match, on 6 March 1990, an important one in the context of the\ntournament. We had lost to Australia in the second game and now needed to beat New Zealand to stay\nin  contention  for  the  final.  I  made  36  runs  off  thirty-nine  balls,  in  the  process  attacking  their  seam\nbowlers for the first time and hitting them for quite a few boundaries. We won the game by one run,\nwith  Martin  Snedden  run  out  and  Richard  Hadlee  bowled  in  the  final  over  by  Kapil  Dev,  who  was\ndeclared Man of the Match for his all-round performance. For the first time my innings had been of\nuse  to  the  team  in  an  official  ODI.  I  couldn’t  do  much  celebrating,  though,  because  I  damaged  my\nright  quadriceps  during  the  game  and  had  to  be  carried  off  the  field.  I  couldn’t  walk  at  all  by  the\nevening and was on crutches for the next few days. It was the first serious injury of my career and my\ntournament was over.\nWhile we were in New Zealand, Asha Bhosle, one of the all-time great Indian singers, happened to\nbe performing in Wellington and the team decided to go to her concert. It was the first time I had seen\nher live and I just loved the experience. Asha Bhosle and Lata Mangeshkar, another of India’s finest\nsingers, are still two of my favourites and to see them perform is always very special.\nOn my return to India, my father told me that I had to hone my God-given cricketing ability. He was\nright. It was time for more hard work to master the skills needed to face the fast swinging ball and I\nwas determined to put in the hours in the nets.\nIndia in England, July–August 1990\nAfter the New Zealand series, India travelled to England for what was our most important assignment\nof  the  year.  India  had  won  a  Test  series  in  England  in  1986  and  we  were  all  looking  forward  to\nrepeating  the  feat.  We  had  a  training  camp  in  Bangalore  just  before  the  series  and  Bishan  Bedi\ncontinued with his policy of making us run miles every day. We had to jog in a line at Cubbon Park,\nopposite the Chinnaswamy Stadium, and the last man in the line had to sprint to the front. The same\ndrill was followed for all the players and the exhausting routine finally resulted in Manoj Prabhakar\njokingly suggesting that he was so fast now he would reach the batsman before his delivery did.\nI had been to England twice before, in 1987–88 and 1988–89, as part of the Star Cricket Club, the\nteam of Kailash Gattani (a former fast bowler who played first-class cricket for Rajasthan in Indian\ndomestic  cricket).  In  the  first  instance,  I  was  sponsored  by  the  Kolkata-based  Young  Cricketers\nOrganization, who contributed my airfare. Among other things, I remember the tour for the food we\nate. We stayed in school and college dormitories and had breakfast in their dining halls. For the first\ntime in my life I was served cold meat for breakfast. That meat could be eaten cold was a revelation to\nme!\nI  was  also  amazed  to  see  so  many  different  types  of  cars.  I  have  always  had  an  interest  in  cars,\nthough we didn’t own one at the time. Kailash Gattani had hired a luxury sedan and I was keen to find\nout as much as I could about the engineering details of these fascinating machines. Besides playing\ncricket, these were things that kept me occupied and I thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity of exploring\na foreign country. Visiting Lord’s, the mecca of world cricket, was a dream come true, and it all added\nto my ambition to play at such venues as a member of the Indian cricket team.\nIn  1990,  the  tour  started  with  a  few  first-class  fixtures,  which  were  followed  by  two  one-day\ninternationals.  While  I  was  in  good  form  at  the  start  of  the  tour  and  scored  runs  in  the  first-class\ngames,  I  didn’t  do  so  well  in  the  first  ODI  at  Leeds  on  18  July,  making  only  19.  Happily,  it  didn’t\nmatter  because  the  team  won  –  thanks  to  the  batting  of  Manjrekar  and Azharuddin  –  and  we  had  a\nchance of victory in the series if we won the next game at Nottingham on the 20th.\nIn  the  second  match  England  produced  a  better  performance,  batting  first,  with  Robin  Smith,  the\nSouth African-born  middle-order  batsman,  contributing  103  to  their  total  of  281.  We  needed  to  bat\nreally well to close out the series. When I went in to bat at number six we needed a further 145 off\ntwenty overs. In those days, that was considered a stiff target. I scored a quick 31 off twenty-six balls\nand was dismissed with the score on 249, with 33 still needed to win, but we won the match and the\nseries 2–0, with Azhar seeing us home with an unbeaten 63. It was a perfect start to the tour, giving us\nsome welcome confidence going into the Test series.\nFirst Test, Lord’s, 26–31 July 1990\nThe first Test at Lord’s will always be remembered for Graham Gooch’s heroics with the bat. After\nbeing  dropped  on  33,  he  went  on  to  make  a  triple  hundred.  He  was  eventually  out  for  333  and  then\nproduced another century in the second innings. For India, the highlights were Azhar’s hundred and\nKapil Dev hitting four successive sixes off Eddie Hemmings, the off-spinner, to save the follow-on.\nMy  only  significant  contribution  in  the  match  was  a  catch  off  leg-spinner  Narendra  Hirwani’s\nbowling to dismiss England’s batting mainstay Allan Lamb in the second innings. It remains the most\nmemorable catch of my career. Hirwani had beaten Lamb in the flight as he stepped out to hit straight\ndown the ground. Despite failing to get to the pitch of the ball, Lamb went through with the shot and\nthe ball went high into the air, looking as if it was going to land some 25 yards behind the bowler.\nAs soon as Lamb hit the shot, I started sprinting from my position at long off. There was very little\nchance that I would make it, because I had been positioned a few yards wide of the conventional long-\noff position. It was only during the last few steps that I realized I had an outside chance. I had covered\na distance of more than 25 yards and was still short. I could dive forward, but I knew I would not have\nenough control to catch the ball. The other option was to carry on sprinting and try somehow to get a\nhand to the ball, which was dying on me. I chose the second option and to my surprise felt the ball\nland in my fully outstretched right hand at knee height.\nHaving  completed  the  catch,  I  threw  the  ball  up  in  the  air  in  sheer  ecstasy.  My  team-mates  were\nnaturally delighted. Hirwani rushed to congratulate me and I felt thrilled at having pulled it off. The\ncrowd appreciated the athletic effort and I vividly remember the warm applause as I walked back to\nmy fielding position. The key to taking catches like these, it seems to me, is not to be afraid of taking\nthe initiative and deciding quickly, while always keeping an eye on the trajectory of the ball.\nWe lost the Lord’s Test by the huge margin of 247 runs and needed to tighten our game before the\nsecond Test at Old Trafford a week later to remain alive in the series.\nSecond Test, Old Trafford, 9–14 August 1990\nIn  the  first  innings  at  Old  Trafford,  England  once  again  put  together  a  total  of  more  than  500,  with\ncenturies from Gooch and Mike Atherton, and we simply had to get as close to their score as possible\nin our reply. We were due to bat fourth in the match and any total in excess of 250 would be difficult\nto chase down on a wearing pitch. Azhar made another hundred and almost everyone in the top order\ncontributed to our first-innings effort. Had the lower middle order scored runs, we may have got closer\nto the English total and even managed a first-innings lead. It might also have given me an opportunity\nto go for my maiden hundred. But they got out in quick succession and I ran out of partners. I went in\nto bat at number six with the team score on 246 and was last man out for 68, trying to play a big shot\noff  Eddie  Hemmings. As  Hirwani  would  I  am  sure  agree,  he  was  not  the  best  number  eleven  in  the\nworld. I felt I had to go for my shots sooner rather than later and I holed out to Chris Lewis at deep\nmidwicket as a result.\nHirwani was always fun to bat with and when he came in he said to me at the wicket that he would\nbe fine as long as the balls were pitched up. He said he had a problem facing bouncers and I assured\nhim  that  the  English  bowlers  would  not  bowl  bouncers  at  him  because  he  wasn’t  a  recognized\nbatsman. He managed to bat on for a while and gradually gained in confidence. So much so that he\nsuddenly charged out to Chris Lewis to give the ball a real whack. Chris’s expression said it all. He\ndid not take kindly to a number-eleven batsman giving him the charge. He was fuming as he walked\nback to his bowling mark and a bouncer was now inevitable. However, in charging out Hirwani had\nsomehow  broken  his  bat  and  it  took  a  bit  of  time  to  get  a  replacement  from  the  dressing  room.\nLuckily,  the  few  minutes  that  were  lost  in  the  bat  change  had  a  calming  effect  on  Chris  Lewis  and\nHirwani survived his innings unscathed.\nWe were finally all out for 432, conceding an 87-run first-innings lead. It was evident that England\nwould want to score quickly and set us a target. Allan Lamb made a hundred in the England second\ninnings  and  on  the  final  day  they  declared  on  320–4,  leaving  us  ninety-two  overs  to  bat  out.  The\nEnglish attack, consisting of Angus Fraser, Chris Lewis, Devon Malcolm and Eddie Hemmings, had\nsome  variety,  and  while  the  fast  bowlers  used  the  cloud  cover  to  good  effect,  Hemmings  extracted\nconsiderable purchase from the fifth-day track. With all the bowlers performing at their best, we were\nsoon  reduced  to  109–4.  Then Azhar  fell  with  the  score  on  127  and  Kapil  Dev  was  yorked  by  Eddie\nHemmings, leaving us at a perilous 183–6.\nMy first Test hundred\nWhen Manoj Prabhakar joined me in the middle we badly needed a partnership to save the game. I had\nbeen lucky at the start of my innings, with Eddie Hemmings dropping me when I had tried to play an\non drive. The ball had hit the outside part of my bat and spooned back to Hemmings, who failed to\nhold on to it. I learnt my lesson and decided not to play any more uppish strokes. At the same time I\nwas determined to play some shots and not go into my shell. Getting ultra-defensive would allow the\nEnglish bowlers to put more and more fielders round the bat, and by trying to score I would be able to\nkeep the field spread out. Every time I got a chance to score runs, I did so. Most of my scoring strokes\nwere in the nature of punches played with minimum risk. The balance between aggression and caution\nwas crucial and I was trying to focus on each and every ball. My fifty came up but it did not excite me.\nThe match was far from saved and that was the goal.\nAt the other end, Manoj Prabhakar was playing well and after a while it was clear we had succeeded\nin frustrating the English bowlers. The first task had been accomplished. When trying to save a match,\nthe important thing is to set small targets. These can be as little as batting the next five overs, or the\nnext  hour,  or  even  a  session.  If  a  wicket  doesn’t  fall  for  close  to  a  session,  the  opposition,  however\nmuch they are in control, are bound to feel pressure. Time was gradually running out for England and\nrestlessness was creeping in.\nWhen I passed 90 runs, it was obvious that the thought of scoring a hundred would start to affect\nme. After all, it would be my first international century and the crowd had already started expecting it\nfrom me. I reminded myself of what had happened in New Zealand and was conscious not to repeat\nthe same mistake. There was still some time left in the day’s play and England could press for victory\nif I got out.\nIn  the  mid-nineties  I  got  a  lucky  reprieve  against Angus  Fraser.  He  bowled  me  a  bouncer  and  I\nducked under it with my bat held above my head like a periscope. The ball hit the back of the bat and\nwent  along  the  ground  to  fine  leg.  It  could  have  gone  straight  into  the  hands  of  any  of  the  close-in\nfielders or to the wicketkeeper. But it didn’t. I was glad and thanked God for the reprieve.\nAt  Old  Trafford  luck  seemed  to  be  with  me.  I  batted  patiently  until  I  finally  played  a  punch  off\nAngus Fraser through mid off when on 98. Chris Lewis chased down the ball but by the time he threw\nit back to the bowler I had run three, completing my first Test hundred. The crowd stood to applaud\nbut  I  was  extremely  uncomfortable  about  acknowledging  them.  I  had  never  been  in  that  position\nbefore and was acutely embarrassed about raising my bat to the stadium.\nEvery  time  I  look  back  at  the  footage  of  my  first  century,  I  realize  that  celebrating  was  not\nsomething  that  came  naturally  to  me.  It  was  only  with  time  that  I  became  more  confident  of  my\npresence in the middle. ‘Presence’ is actually very important in international sport. It is one thing just\nbeing there in the middle, but it is another making people aware of your ‘presence’. It is about body\nlanguage and radiating confidence, something that the West Indian batting legend Viv Richards would\npersonify.  With  me  it  happened  after  I  had  scored  a  few  hundreds  and  felt  more  established  in\ninternational cricket. As I grew more assured of my presence, I came up with my own signature style\nof celebrating an achievement by showing the bat to the dressing room. Most cricketers develop their\nown style of celebrating. For example, the way Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne showed the ball to\nthe crowd after picking up five wickets in an innings was something they evolved over the course of\ntheir careers.\nAt Old Trafford I continued to bat on after reaching my hundred and with every passing over it was\nbecoming apparent that the match would end in a draw. When the match was finally called off with\ntwo  of  the  twenty  mandatory  overs  still  to  be  bowled,  we  had  reached  343  for  no  further  losses.\nPrabhakar and I had put together an unbeaten 160-run stand.\nI remember walking back to the pavilion to a standing ovation. Both umpires, John Hampshire and\nJohn Holder, congratulated me on my hundred and all the England players walked up to me to offer\nsome kind words. In the dressing room my team-mates congratulated me – not just on my maiden Test\nhundred but also for batting through the day and saving the game for the team, meaning that it was all\nto play for in the third Test. It was the second occasion I had done so. This one was more satisfying,\nthough,  because  this  time  I  played  a  central  part  in  the  effort,  unlike  in  the  fourth  Test  in  Pakistan,\nwhere I had a supporting role.\nJust when I was about to relax after a good day’s work, I was informed that I had to face the media.\nIt was going to be the first time I addressed a press conference. I asked our manager Madhav Mantri, a\nformer Test cricketer who toured England with India in the 1950s, if it was compulsory or if I could\njust  skip  it.  He  assured  me  it  was  a  routine  matter  and  said  that  the  journalists  would  only  ask  me\nquestions about my performance and about the match. My team-mates, however, started pulling my\nleg,  saying  they’d  ask  me  questions  I  couldn’t  answer  and  that  it  was  going  to  be  a  really  difficult\nsession. Looking back, I must admit that I quite enjoyed the experience. I was uncomfortable to start\nwith, but it was quite straightforward really. I just needed to share my thoughts and it wasn’t such a\ndaunting task after all. Most of the questions were pleasant and it felt good to receive compliments\nfrom well-known cricket writers.\nI  was  declared  Player  of  the  Match  –  my  first  such  award  –  and  once  again  felt  awkward  at  the\nceremony. I was handed the bottle of champagne but, not being eighteen, I didn’t drink at the time. I\njust wanted the presentation to be over and to hurry back to the dressing room with the award as soon\nas  possible.  In  the  end  I  brought  the  bottle  home  with  me  to  Mumbai  and  finally  opened  it  on  the\noccasion of my daughter Sara’s first birthday in 1998.\nOn returning to the hotel after the match I got a call from home and remember speaking to what must\nhave been thirty or forty people on the phone. It was a spontaneous gathering of all my friends at our\nneighbour’s apartment to celebrate the hundred and it was really touching to know that people in the\ncolony  were  so  thrilled  at  the  accomplishment.  Some  of  them  jokingly  mentioned  to  me  that  as  I\nwasn’t  old  enough  to  drink,  they  were  enjoying  a  drink  on  my  behalf.  My  parents  were  extremely\nhappy with my performance and my brother too felt vindicated.\nThe third Test match, at The Oval at the end of August, was another draw, which meant that we lost\nthe  series  0–1,  but  I  was  still  reasonably  satisfied  with  my  performances  in  England  and  felt  I  had\ntaken  a  few  important  strides.  I  returned  to  India  a  better  Test  cricketer  and  far  more  confident  of\nmyself as a performer, ready for the next big challenges: a tour of Australia at the end of the following\nyear, followed by the World Cup jointly organized by Australia and New Zealand.\nIndia in Australia, November 1991–February 1992\nWe began the tour with a couple of one-day practice matches in Perth in November 1991, the first at\nLilac Hill and the second at the WACA, one of the fastest cricket wickets in the world. At the WACA\nwe were bowled out for just 64 and it was clear we had to adjust to Australian conditions as soon as\npossible if we were going to be competitive in the series.\nOur  first  three-day  tour  game  was  against  a  full-strength  New  South  Wales  team  at  Lismore\nbetween  23  and  25  November  and  it  was  in  that  game  that  I  got  my  first  taste  of  real  Australian\ncompetitiveness. It was a fast, lively wicket and Geoff Lawson, the NSW captain, had no hesitation in\nputting  us  in  after  winning  the  toss.  In  addition  to  Lawson,  their  bowling  attack  included  Mike\nWhitney, Steve and Mark Waugh, Greg Matthews and Wayne Holdsworth, and it was a tough test for\nus.  The  team  also  included  Mark  Taylor  and  five  players  –  Whitney,  Lawson,  Steve  Waugh,  Mark\nTaylor and Matthews – had already played Test cricket for Australia.\nI was looking to be aggressive from the very beginning and played a number of horizontal-bat shots\nover point and gully. It was in this match that I had my first exchange with Steve Waugh, who didn’t\nseem  keen  on  the  idea  of  an  eighteen-year-old  attacking  the  bowling  like  that. A  lot  of  things  were\nsaid to me and they were the first of many over the years.\nIt was in the course of this match that the Australian Test team for the first Test at Brisbane was\nannounced. Steve Waugh was not included in the side, so I said to him that if he wanted to fight with\nme, he first needed to get into the Australian team. It was all done in good spirit and throughout our\ncareers we had great mutual respect; in fact, the banter, it must be said, was a result of this. We knew\nhow important it was to get Steve Waugh out early and tried all we could to unsettle him. There were\noccasions when we even resorted to observing total silence when Waugh batted as we came to believe\nthat saying things to him actually strengthened his resolve to do better.\nA tough start\nIn  the  first  Test  at  Brisbane,  starting  on  29  November  1991,  the  Australians  beat  us  convincingly,\nthanks  in  large  part  to  superb  bowling  from  Craig  McDermott  and  Merv  Hughes.  Like  most  of  our\nteam, I didn’t do much with the bat and we knew we had to bounce back in Melbourne in the Boxing\nDay  Test. At  the  MCG  we  remained  competitive  till  the  middle  of  the  third  day,  with  Kiran  More\ncoming  to  the  rescue  with  67  in  our  first  innings  and  Kapil  Dev  and  Prabakhar  both  bowling  well,\nbefore  a  batting  collapse  in  our  second  innings  dampened  our  hopes.  I  managed  to  stay  in  for  a\nreasonable  time  and  scored  40  off  107  balls,  but  I  was  disgusted  with  myself  for  trying  to  hit  a  big\nshot  and  getting  out  caught  by Allan  Border  against  the  off-spinner  Peter  Taylor  after  doing  all  the\nhard work and playing myself in. I was so fed up that I didn’t eat lunch in the dressing room and was\non edge for the whole day!\nSomething  else  happened  in  Melbourne  that  has  never  happened  again  in  my  life,  I’m  pleased  to\nsay. When I went back to the dressing room I realized that my abdominal protector had been broken\ninto three pieces when I was hit by a Bruce Reid delivery. Reid, the tall left-arm fast bowler, got a lot\nof wickets in the series and I was lucky that no major damage was caused by the accident!\nFighting back\nDown 0–2, we went to Sydney for the next Test on 2 January 1992 knowing it was our last chance to\nget back in the series. It was a typical SCG wicket, helpful to the batsmen to start with, and I thought\nour bowlers did very well to bowl Australia out for 313 in the first innings. It was essential for us to\ntake  a  substantial  lead  and  give  our  bowlers  a  chance  to  bowl  Australia  out  again  in  the  second\ninnings. I didn’t sleep much the night before batting. I was sharing a room with Sourav Ganguly, who\nlater captained India and is a very good friend. I remember a startled Sourav waking up in the middle\nof the night and seeing me shadow-practise. Sourav wasn’t playing in that game and was surprised to\nsee me up so late. I told him I was planning how to play McDermott and the other bowlers.\nUnsurprisingly,  the  next  day  I  was  feeling  rather  tired.  India  were  batting  and  I  was  batting  at\nnumber  six,  so  I  decided  to  take  a  nap  on  the  dining  table  inside  the  SCG  dressing  room  –  asking\nSourav to wake up me up at the fall of the next wicket. He did so when Azhar got out. By then I was\nfeeling refreshed and was ready to go out and bat.\nFor  the  first  time  in  the  series  our  top  order  had  fired  and  by  the  time  I  went  in,  the  score  was  a\nhealthy  201–4,  with  Vengsarkar  having  contributed  a  half-century.  We  needed  another  good\npartnership to push on for a lead and, with the opener Ravi Shastri playing extremely well at the other\nend, that’s what we managed to do. The second innings at Melbourne had definitely helped me and I\nwas now able to middle the ball from the very start. There was a phase halfway through when I began\nto lose concentration and feel edgy, but I forced myself to exercise restraint and it soon passed.\nAfter reaching my half-century, I began to play a lot more shots and was soon close to my second\nTest hundred. I vividly remember the glance to fine leg that brought up my century. I ran two and the\nsecond run was the fastest I have ever run. Ravi went on to score an excellent double hundred, the first\nby  an  Indian  in  Australia,  as  we  put  on  196  runs  for  the  fifth  wicket.  Sydney  continues  to  be  my\nfavourite ground outside India and to score my first hundred in Australia at the SCG was special. I had\ngrown up watching cricket in Australia on the TV and used to wake up early to watch the Victoria Cup\nin 1985. Now I was playing at the actual venues and scoring runs.\nThe SCG Test is also remembered for the debut of a plump Australian leg-spinner with a mop of\nblond hair. Though Shane Warne took only one wicket in the match, it was evident to us all that he\ncould give the ball a fair rip. While no one could have predicted the 708 Test wickets he would take in\nhis  career,  the  fact  that  he  had  talent  was  obvious  from  the  very  first  day  he  took  to  the  field  in\nJanuary 1992.\nKnowing that we could bat only once – because of valuable time lost to rain and bad light on the\nthird and fourth days – we batted for close to an hour on the final day and declared with a lead of 170\nruns. With the track doing a fair bit and the bounce turning variable, we had a good chance of closing\nout the game in the time remaining. A win still seemed on the cards when Shastri’s bowling helped\nreduce Australia to 114–6 and it was only some dogged rearguard action from Allan Border and Merv\nHughes that saved Australia.\nIn the one over I bowled I picked up the wicket of Hughes and it was a big moment for me because\nit  was  my  first  wicket  in  Test  cricket.  He  was  caught  by  Prabhakar  in  the  slips  for  21  after  playing\nseventy-three balls, and if we had got his wicket a little earlier, we might have been able to close out\nthe game.\nLearning some lessons\nThe fourth Test of the series started at Adelaide on 25 January 1992 and for the first time I was going\nto bat at the home ground of the legendary Sir Donald Bradman, the greatest batsman to have played\nthe game. While I did not do much at the Adelaide Oval, the team played some good cricket. We lost\nthe match by 38 runs in the end, but we remained competitive throughout and dominated the first two\ndays of the match. Kapil Dev had a good match with both bat and ball and in our second innings Azhar\nplayed a wonderful captain’s innings, scoring 106. He and Prabhakar, who made 64, had brought us to\nthe brink of victory, but we were eventually all out for 333 chasing 371. With a bit of luck, the series\ncould have been 2–2 at Adelaide. Instead we went to Perth for the final Test 0–3 down.\nI scored my second hundred of the series in the fifth Test, which started on 1 February, and I count\nit as one of the very best I have scored. It was a quick wicket and for the first time since my debut I\nwas  going  in  at  number  four  in  a  Test.  I  relished  the  opportunity  from  the  outset  and  hit  sixteen\nboundaries in my 114. By that stage of the tour I had mastered a back-foot punch. While most batsmen\nfavoured  the  cut  shot  at  Perth  because  of  the  extra  bounce,  I  used  the  back-foot  punch  at  every\nopportunity and because I was able to do so against good-length balls, it was making the bowlers’ job\nthat much more difficult. It would usually bring me at least a couple of runs and when I timed the ball\nreally well it would even go all the way to the boundary.\nEarlier,  the  Australian  media  had  talked  up  the  fast,  bouncy  WACA  wicket  and  how  difficult  it\nwould make it for us to cope with the Australian quick bowlers. But I never had a problem batting at\nthe WACA. This was because I managed to adjust to the bounce. Every time the ball got big on me, I\nstayed on the back foot and played the ball with soft hands at the last moment, standing up on my toes\nrather than playing a flat-footed defensive stroke.\nOne  incident  at  the  WACA  brought  home  the  intensity  and  competitiveness  of  the  game  in\nAustralia. I had just played a ball defensively and had no chance of a run. In what I thought was the\nspirit of the game, I was about to pick the ball up and throw it to Allan Border, the Australian captain,\nwho was fielding at gully. When AB spotted me bending down he screamed at me, saying, ‘Don’t you\ndare touch the ball.’ After that I never tried to pick up the ball and throw it back to fielders. It was a\nlesson in how international cricket is played and I remembered it till the last day of my career.\nMeeting a hero\nIt was on this tour of Australia that I first saw a batsman who had been my hero when I was growing\nup – though it wasn’t on the cricket field. I was in a hotel lobby in Adelaide with Sanjay Manjrekar\nwhen  a  cab  pulled  up  outside. A  guy  wearing  a  cap  got  out  and  I  immediately  said,  ‘I’ve  seen  him\nsomewhere before.’ As he got closer I said, ‘I don’t believe it – that’s Viv Richards!’\nWhen he walked past us and headed up to his room, I turned to Sanjay and told him that I just had to\nmeet my hero. So we went to Reception and found out his room number and I made Sanjay call him –\nSanjay had played a series against him in the West Indies in 1989 – and before long we were on our\nway to his room. That was my first meeting with Viv. I spent only three minutes with him, just to say\nhello, but it was a very exciting moment for me.\n1992 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand\nAfter the Test series we stayed in Australia, as the World Cup – my first – was just a few weeks away.\nThe  idea  was  to  help  us  acclimatize  to  the  conditions,  not  that  this  was  necessary  after  being  in\nAustralia for close to three months. We had a few weeks to ourselves and with Vinod Kambli around\nthere was never a dull moment. Vinod and I shared a room and one thing that always stood out about\nhim  was  his  dress  sense.  Vinod’s  clothes  were  as  colourful  as  they  could  possibly  get  and  on  one\noccasion our manager Ranbir Singh Mahendra even said to him, ‘Arre India ke liye khel rahe ho, aise\nclown jaise dress kyun pehente ho tum? Kuch dhang ka kapda pehna karo. ’ (You are playing for India.\nWhy do you dress like a clown? You should wear some decent clothes and dress sensibly.) Not that it\nhad any impact on Vinod, though!\nThose  few  weeks  were  relatively  stress-free  and  we  spent  a  lot  of  time  relaxing  in  each  other’s\ncompany. On one occasion the leg-spinner Narendra Hirwani and I were having tea in our physio Dr\nAli Irani’s room. Ali used to make special tea for us, with a particular kind of sugar. In the middle of\nour conversation Ali got a call from Ranbir Singh Mahendra, who was a vegetarian, asking if he could\nget  him  some  garlic  bread. After  the  call Ali  turned  all  philosophical  and  said,  ‘There  will  come  a\ntime when you guys will be there and will think about old Ali Irani who used to take care of us and\nmake us really nice tea.’\nHirwani and I found it funny that he had turned unnaturally thoughtful and Hirwani asked him to\nrepeat what he had just said. Ali was reluctant to do so but when Hirwani insisted, he said it again. At\nthis Hirwani jokingly said to Ali with reference to his efforts to keep Ranbir Singh Mahendra in good\nhumour,  ‘Tu  to  har  din  200  marta  hai.  India  team  mein  tera  naam  pehle  likha  jata  hai.  Uske  baad\nhamara  naam  aata  hai.’  (You  score  a  double  hundred  every  day  by  being  in  the  good  books  of  the\nmanager. Your name will come first in an Indian team and only then will our names be listed.)\nIn  the  World  Cup,  India  failed  to  make  the  semi-finals,  despite  being  competitive  in  most  of  the\nmatches. We lost to England and Australia by the narrow margin of nine runs and one run respectively\nand our second match against Sri Lanka at Mackay on 28 February was washed out because of rain.\nThe  high  point  of  the  tournament  for  us  was  the  match  against  eventual  winners  Pakistan  on  4\nMarch  1992  at  Sydney.  After  two  consecutive  defeats,  we  were  determined  to  turn  things  round\nagainst Pakistan. Batting first, we had to negotiate a hostile spell of fast bowling from Wasim Akram.\nAt one stage he was bowling magnificently to Vinod Kambli and, batting at the other end, I just kept\ntelling Vinod to nudge the ball and run. We put together an important partnership and I followed it up\nwith another with Kapil Dev, who scored a valuable 35 off just twenty-six balls. I was unbeaten on 54\nat the end of the innings.\nOur  total  of  216  wasn’t  a  big  score  to  defend,  but  we  started  well  and  Kapil  Dev  and  Prabakhar\npicked up two early wickets for very little on the board. Our bowlers and fielders were charged up and\nthere  was  a  lot  of  chat  out  in  the  middle.  We  were  cheering  each  other  on  and  giving  the  Pakistan\nbatsmen a hard time.\nThis  match  is  often  remembered  for  the  tussle  between  our  wicketkeeper  Kiran  More  and  Javed\nMiandad. Javed, if I remember right, was having back spasms and could not play his strokes freely. He\nwas finding it difficult to bat but was performing an uncharacteristic job for his team, trying to anchor\nthe innings and hold up one end. Behind the stumps, Kiran was constantly up and down, shouting out\ninstructions  to  our  bowlers,  saying  Javed  was  in  no  position  to  play  his  shots.  Infuriated  at  the\ncontinuous  chatter,  Javed  imitated  Kiran’s  actions  by  doing  a  frog  jump.  We  were  all  stunned  and\namused  at  the  same  time  and  this  tiff  between  Kiran  and  Javed  made  the  eventual  victory  even\nsweeter.\nI  bowled  my  full  quota  of  ten  overs,  conceding  just  37  runs  and  picking  up  the  vital  wicket  of\nopener Aamer Sohail. It was a satisfying win and by the end of the match I had completely lost my\nvoice  because  of  all  the  shouting.  It  was  the  first  time  India  had  played  Pakistan  in  the  World  Cup\nsince the inception of the tournament in 1975 and it was the start of a string of victories against them\nin World Cups. The 1992 victory was particularly pleasing because I was also Player of the Match.\nWhen  we  returned  to  India  at  the  end  of  March  after  four  and  a  half  months  in Australia  I  was  a\ntransformed  cricketer.  The  1991–92  Australia  tour  undoubtedly  had  a  fundamental  impact  on  my\ncareer.\nA brave man\nThe story of the Australia tour is incomplete without a story that has stayed with me over the years. It\ninvolves Venkatapathy Raju, our left-arm spinner, and Merv Hughes. They were great pals and on a\nflight  to  Perth,  which  is  a  little  under  four  hours  from  Sydney,  we  dared  Raju,  one  of  the  skinniest\ncricketers  in  the  team,  to  go  and  grab  Hughes’s  famous  thick  moustache.  Merv,  a  huge  man,  was\nknown for his volatile temper and most of us were convinced that Raju would chicken out in the end.\nTo our surprise, he boldly went up to Merv and pulled his moustache, a feat of incredible bravery – or\nfoolishness.  Merv  took  it  all  very  sportingly  and  the  act  was  applauded  by  everyone  on  the  flight,\nmaking Raju an instant hero.\nIndia in New Zealand 1990\n1st Test.

            "title": "ANJALI\n",
            "data": "As  I  was  trying  to  establish  myself  as  an  international  cricketer,  my  personal  life  changed\ndramatically in August 1990 when I met Anjali, my future wife. It was the beginning of by far the best\npartnership of my life.\nI had just landed in Mumbai on our return from the 1990 tour of England and was waiting to pick up\nmy bags when I first saw an extremely attractive woman looking down from the viewing gallery in the\nairport. Little did I know then that I had just seen my life partner. She was standing with a friend of\nhers, Dr Aparna Santhanam, now a well-known dermatologist in Mumbai. We had fleeting eye contact\nand then she disappeared.\nThe  next  I  saw  of  the  two  of  them  was  when  I  was  making  my  way  out  of  the  airport.  I  spotted\nAnjali, dressed in an orange T-shirt and blue jeans, running out of the gate, apparently chasing after\nme. That was not all, because she soon started yelling, ‘He is sooooo cute!’ I felt awkward and started\nto blush, as I knew both Ajit and Nitin were waiting outside to take me home. My childhood friend\nSunil Harshe was with me and he murmured in my ear that a very good-looking girl was calling my\nname  and  seemed  keen  to  meet  up  with  me.  I  had  of  course  seen  her  and  found  her  particularly\nattractive, but I told him there was no way I could speak to her at the time, not with Ajit and Nitin\naround.\nThe years of courtship\nAnjali  and  I  courted  each  other  for  five  years  between  1990  and  1995,  a  commitment  that  led  to\nengagement  and  finally  marriage.  It  has  to  be  said  that  the  two  of  us  come  from  very  different\nbackgrounds. Anjali is half Gujarati, half English and is a South Mumbai girl from a very well-to-do\nfamily.  She  went  to  St  Xavier’s  College  and  then  studied  medicine  at  JJ  Hospital.  She  was  well-\nspoken and had an upbringing fundamentally different from my own. In her family, wearing Western\noutfits was the norm. My situation was completely different. I had hardly ever been out of my colony\nand had always mingled with cricket friends. I had never gone out with a girl, let alone brought one\nhome. Unlike most men of my age, who were able to meet girls at college, I had been playing for India\nfrom the age of sixteen and simply hadn’t had the opportunity.\nWhile I first saw Anjali at Mumbai airport, it turns out that she had actually seen me a few weeks\nearlier on 14 August, when I got my first Test hundred at Old Trafford. At the time she was in England\nwith  her  parents,  and  her  father,  Anand  Mehta,  a  former  national  bridge  champion  and  a  serious\ncricket fan, had called her to catch a glimpse of the innings on television. However, she had no interest\nin cricket and didn’t watch at all. Soon afterwards she came back to India and it was when she went to\nthe  airport  to  receive  her  mother,  Annabel,  who  is  English  but  has  worked  in  India  tirelessly  as  a\nsocial worker for more than three decades, that we ran into each other for the first time.\nThe day after she saw me at the airport – and this is her version, by the way – she asked a friend of\nhers, Mufi Muffazal Lakdawala (who played club cricket and is now a very well-known surgeon), if he\ncould  get  her  my  phone  number.  After  coming  home  from  the  airport,  she  apparently  jokingly\ndeclared to her parents that she had seen the man she wanted to marry.\nMufi did get her my number but it was pure chance that I happened to pick up her call. There were\nno mobile phones then and I was hardly ever at home to pick up the land line. The stars, I can say in\nhindsight, were aligned. She said she was the girl from the airport and asked if we could meet. While\nnot trying to sound too eager, I told her that I remembered her and could meet with her at the Cricket\nClub of India, where I was playing. At first she did not believe me and asked if I could remember what\nshe was wearing on the day I had first seen her. When I mentioned the orange T-shirt and blue jeans,\nshe was impressed.\nShe came along to the CCI, as we’d arranged, but we couldn’t really meet up and talk properly with\nso  many  people  around.  Being  discreet  was  the  best  thing  under  the  circumstances. All  we  did  was\nexchange numbers and after that we started talking on the phone fairly regularly. It wasn’t long before\nmy sister-in-law Meena began to suspect that something was cooking between the two of us. She often\nasked  me  about  this  girl  who  kept  on  calling  me  but  I  tried  to  avoid  answering.  I  wasn’t  used  to\ndiscussing private things with my family and felt distinctly uncomfortable.\nOur first proper meeting finally happened at my house when we came up with the idea that Anjali\nshould  come  over  posing  as  a  reporter  wanting  an  interview.  That  was  her  first  and  last  foray  into\njournalism. A female reporter had never come to my home for an interview before and, in light of all\nthe phone calls, my sister-in-law was particularly suspicious about who this special reporter was.\nFor  that  first  visit,  I  was  keen  to  offer Anjali  something  to  eat  and  was  disappointed  to  see  that\nhardly any of the chocolates I had brought back from England remained. In fact, there were only two\nleft and in my keenness to salvage the situation I carefully cut them up and set a plate of chocolate\npieces in front of her. She couldn’t stay for long, however, and our first meeting was much too brief\nfor my liking.\nDespite being brief, it left a lasting impression. I simply felt happy in her presence. I can’t really\npinpoint what I liked about her but what I can say is that I was able to relax and be myself with her\nfrom  the  very  first  day.  I  had  intentionally  spoken  very  little  because  I  was  worried  about\nembarrassing myself by saying something stupid. She did most of the talking and that was fine with\nme.  In  any  case,  at  the  time  I  wasn’t  as  fluent  with  my  English,  which  was  the  language  of\nconversation. It was perhaps a defensive act, but Anjali never made me feel self-conscious. She was\njust the most ideal soulmate I could have asked for.\nWhile we continued to speak for long periods on the phone after our first meeting, we hardly ever\ngot a chance to meet. On some occasions we did plan to meet at around 8.30 p.m. and go for a drive.\nHowever,  it  turned  out  that  Anjali’s  parents,  who  were  unaware  of  the  relationship  then,  were\nwatching  television  and  so,  despite  wanting  to  meet, Anjali  was  unable  to  leave  the  house  without\narousing suspicion. For my part, I drove all the way from Bandra to Warden Road, a journey of about\nforty  minutes,  and  waited  in  the  car  until  I  was  finally  forced  to  turn  back.  Because  of  the  risk  of\npeople recognizing me, I couldn’t even call her from the public phone close to her house (there were\nno mobiles then) and had to go all the way back to Bandra to find out what had gone wrong, then I’d\nask  her  to  try  again  and  drive  all  the  way  back.  Needless  to  say,  I  am  now  an  ardent  advocate  of\nmobile technology!\nThe second time we met was when Anjali suggested I pick her up from her house and we go for a\ndrive  in  her  Maruti  800,  India’s  most  affordable  small  car  in  the  early  1990s.  She  wanted  to  have\ncoconut water along Marine Drive and it was the only time in our lives that we have sat on the bench\nopposite the Air India building in Mumbai drinking coconut water. In my eagerness to please her, I\nhad agreed, despite knowing that there was a possibility of people spotting me and coming up to speak\nto  me.  The  century  in  England  had  made  me  a  household  name  and  people  had  started  to  ask  for\nautographs.  I  did  not  mention  this  to  her  in  case  she  thought  I  was  pompous.  Because Anjali  knew\nnothing about cricket, it had never occurred to her that people might recognize me. She simply wasn’t\naware of how public a cricketer’s life in India can be. It is true that there is hardly any privacy, which\nmeans that we’ve never been able to do the things couples normally do – watch a film, stop at roadside\neateries in the evening, take a walk along the beach and the like. It was an adjustment Anjali and I had\nto make very early on in our lives together. The one time we tried to defy the odds was when a few of\nus – Anjali, her father Anand and some of our friends – went to see the film  Roja in Worli in South\nMumbai  in  1993.  We  planned  the  outing  meticulously  and  I  put  on  a  wig,  a  false  moustache  and\nglasses in an attempt to hide my identity. Things went smoothly till the interval, when I dropped my\nglasses and broke one of the lenses. My friends asked me not to put the broken spectacles back on just\nin  case  something  went  into  my  eye,  but  in  my  panic  the  moustache  came  off  too  and  soon  people\nrecognized me, causing us all a lot of embarrassment. There was such pandemonium that we had to\nflee from the cinema halfway through the film.\nWe  had  a  similar  experience  in  Switzerland  just  a  few  years  ago,  when  we  were  holidaying  as  a\nfamily. I had suggested we stay in a chalet rather than in a hotel and do our own cooking. Things were\ngoing to plan till the day we decided to visit Interlaken, now famous for Indian tourists as the location\nof  the  hit  Bollywood  musical Dilwale  Dulhania  Le  Jayenge.  We  had  planned  to  leave  early  in  the\nmorning  and  walk  to  the  site.  A  few  of  our  friends  had  advised  us  not  to  do  so  in  case  people\nrecognized me on the way, so instead we hired a horse and carriage. Just as we were setting out, a few\nof the other Indian tourists spotted me. Within minutes they started following us and even when I told\nthe carriage driver to go faster, they kept running behind us, trying to catch up. It was only when they\nrealized that they couldn’t keep pace that they finally gave up.\nSuch intrusion meant that Anjali and I could hardly meet in public and after our second meeting we\nweren’t  in  touch  at  all  for  a  period  of  six  months.  I  was  away  on  tours,  while  Anjali  was  busy\npreparing for her medical finals. I knew how hard she had worked and was sure she’d do well in the\nexam. On the day of the exam I rang her from Australia very early in the morning to wish her luck. I\nmust say I was delighted to hear her voice after so long. She was panicking and was worried that she’d\nfail the exam. Knowing that was impossible, I said to her that if she failed the examination, so would\neveryone else in Mumbai. She had always come top and there was no way it would be different this\ntime  round.  I  also  said  that  the  number  of  hours  she  studied  in  a  day  equalled  the  total  number  of\nhours I used to study in a whole month! It was only much later that she told me that my call made a\nbig difference to her. She felt I must have really cared to have called from Australia after six months.\nIt was far more than care, as far as I was concerned.\nAs  expected,  she  topped  the  examination  and  wanted  to  go  ahead  with  pursuing  an  MD  in\npaediatrics. I was extremely proud of her achievement and encouraged her to do so, which resulted in\nher  getting  posted  to  a  hospital  at  Palghar,  on  the  outskirts  of  Mumbai,  as  an  intern.  Luckily  for  us\nboth, her friend Mufi was also posted in the same hospital. Palghar was such a small town that Anjali\nhad to take a train to Boisar, some twenty minutes away, to find a phone to call me, and Mufi was her\npartner during these trips.\nIt  was  while  studying  for  the  MD  that  she  began  to  take  more  of  an  interest  in  cricket.  We  had\nstarted talking about the game on the phone and she even bought a book of rules. Often she’d come up\nwith questions like: where’s cow corner, or is the wicketkeeper right- or left-handed? But she picked\nup the game quickly and I would ask her questions from time to time to keep her interest going. The\nfirst tournament she watched on television was the 1992 World Cup and she was heartbroken to see\nme get out cheaply against the West Indies after I had edged a ball from Curtly Ambrose. So much so\nthat Mufi had to console her, saying the ball was so good that others wouldn’t have come near it and it\nwas because of my exceptional batting prowess that I had managed to somehow get an edge. If only\nthat were the truth!\nIn the absence of mobile phones and text messages at the time, Anjali and I wrote a series of letters\nto each other. Because I was not stationed in a particular city for more than a few days when on tour,\nAnjali  would  have  to  work  out  where  I  would  be  in  two  or  three  weeks’  time  and  post  the  letters\naccordingly.  These  letters  remain  prized  possessions  and  when  I  look  at  them  again  one  thing  that\nstands out is Anjali’s handwriting. Compared to mine, hers was wonderful to look at. I also have to\nconfess  that  writing  did  not  come  naturally  to  me.  I  would  often  take  a  very  long  time  thinking\nthrough each word that I would write for my beloved.\nAfter coming back from the World Cup in March 1992, I visited Anjali in her family’s house for the\nfirst  time.  Once  again  Mufi  played  a  crucial  role.  Anjali’s  parents  were  told  that  it  was  our  first\nmeeting  and  that  Mufi  had  orchestrated  the  visit.  It  was  carefully  stage-managed  and  was  quite  a\nperformance.  In  fact,  it  was  only  after  we  decided  to  get  engaged  that  we  told  her  parents  the  real\nstory. I must say I was extremely thankful to Mufi for all the help.\nWe weren’t comfortable with the fact that the relationship was still a secret and decided it was time\nwe let our families know that we were serious about each other. So I asked my childhood friend Sunil\nHarshe  to  arrange  for Ajit  and Anjali  to  meet,  and  the  three  of  them  got  together  at  the  Willingdon\nClub in South Mumbai. Waiting at home, I was anxious the whole time the meeting was on. It wasn’t\nthat I was looking for approval as such from Ajit, but it meant a lot to me to see my friends and family\nlike Anjali as much as I did. I remember waiting for what seemed like an age, but when I finally saw\nSunil and Ajit coming back, Sunil, who was walking one step behind Ajit, gave me a quick thumbs up\nto indicate the meeting had gone well. I was delighted to know that Ajit too thought Anjali was the\nright person for me.\nAll this time Anjali’s interest in cricket was growing and by the time I went to New Zealand in 1994\nshe had a grasp of the nuances of the game. It was the series in which I started opening the batting for\nIndia  in  one-day  cricket.  I  was  delighted  with  my  new  role  and  was  happy  to  be  able  to  share  my\nsentiments with Anjali when I spoke to her from New Zealand.\nBy the end of the New Zealand tour we had been seeing each other for four years and it was time to\nmove on to the next stage of the relationship. It was during one of our numerous phone conversations\nfrom New Zealand that Anjali broached the subject of engagement and I immediately took her up on\nthe suggestion. I told her that I was ready to get engaged whenever she was but it would be better if\nshe  could  speak  to  both  of  our  parents  on  my  behalf  –  talking  was  never  my  strong  point.  She  was\nhesitant at first but it was a great relief to me when she reluctantly agreed to take on the responsibility,\nas  I  would  not  have  felt  comfortable  discussing  the  engagement  with  my  father.  Not  that  my  father\nwould not have agreed – I was absolutely certain he would – it was just that I felt slightly embarrassed\nat the thought of discussing my future wife with him.\nAnjali later told me that she too had initially felt self-conscious informing my parents that their son\nwanted to get engaged to her. But my parents knew me well enough to realize why she had ended up\nbeing the one to speak to them about it and all they wanted to know was if we both felt the same way\nabout the engagement. They were in fact delighted with the decision. The same thing happened a year\nlater, when it was Anjali who spoke to both families about our wedding plans. She has far better social\nskills  than  I  do  and  I  was  once  again  relieved  to  see  her  take  on  the  rather  difficult  task.  I  have  no\nhesitation in acknowledging that she did a commendable job!\nEngagement and marriage\nWe  got  engaged  on  24  April  1994,  which  also  happened  to  be  my  twenty-first  birthday.  The\nengagement party was a low-key affair with family and close friends and was held at Anjali’s family’s\nhouse at Warden Road, Breach Candy, in South Mumbai. It was an occasion of great significance in\nour lives and we will always remember the joy we felt. Our families were delighted at the union and it\nmarked a whole new beginning for me. We finally tied the knot on 25 May 1995. Anjali Mehta had\nbecome Anjali Tendulkar and I entered a new phase in my life.\nEven before we got engaged, Anjali had mentioned to me that she wanted me to pursue my dream\nand was willing to give up her career for the family. This was a huge sacrifice. We were aware that it\nwas impossible for us both to continue with our respective careers and that one of us needed to be at\nhome to take charge of the house and family. To my relief, Anjali took over the home front, allowing\nme to continue with my cricket, and I will always appreciate the sacrifice she made very early in our\nlives.\nThe  wedding  was  a  traditional  affair  and,  as  in  most  conventional  Maharashtrian  households,  my\nmother  gave  Anjali  the  mangalsutra  (a  necklace  worn  by  the  wife  to  ensure  her  husband’s  good\nhealth),  sindoor  (vermilion,  the  red  powder  worn  as  an  auspicious  mark  by  Indian  married  women),\ngreen  bangles,  anklets  and  a  toe  ring,  which  are  all  considered  part  of  the  wedding  ritual.  In  fact,  I\nremember her asking me if I wanted her to wear all or any of the things that my mother had given her.\nAll I said was I wanted her to wear the mangalsutra, and to this day she has never taken it off.\nThese adjustments, both in her professional and personal life, could not have been easy but she has\nnever shown any resentment. This has not only added to my respect for Anjali but also meant I had\nactually found someone who I could love and depend on. I must confess it is not always in my nature\nto say what I feel, but there is no doubt how much I owe her. Funnily enough, I have never called her\nby  her  name.  I  haven’t  ever  said  ‘Anjali’  or  ‘Anja’  or  any  such  thing  while  calling  her.  In  all  these\nyears I have not been able to figure out how I should refer to her. Frankly, it doesn’t really matter, for\nthat is how I am and, despite all my shortcomings, my wife has been with me every step of the way.\nAt the beginning, marriage did have one unfortunate side-effect, however. Marital bliss led me to\nrelax  my  routine  and  the  outcome  was  weight  gain.  I  enjoyed  myself  thoroughly  during  our\nhoneymoon and indulged my palate to a nicety. We had a few of our friends with us in Goa, where I\nwas also playing a double-wicket tournament, and that added to the fun. Almost every day during the\nhoneymoon I feasted on deliciously decadent desserts and other delicacies I normally kept away from\nduring the playing season. There were plenty of chocolates and ice creams and such indulgence came\nat a price.\nWhen I returned to Mumbai I realized that I couldn’t get into any of my clothes. I had put on a few\ninches  around  the  waist  and  it  was  time  for  some  strict  control  on  the  culinary  front.  We  weren’t\nplaying a great deal of cricket in 1995 and that was another reason why I had let down my guard. So\nfor twenty straight days after returning to Mumbai, I put myself on a diet of nothing but tea without\nsugar,  boiled chana (chickpeas), oranges and sweet lime. I also started doing some rigorous exercise\nagain to get back into shape. I used to run for an hour in the morning, followed by weight training, and\nplayed two hours of table-tennis every evening. And during the table-tennis sessions I’d go and fetch\nthe  ball  from  wherever  it  went.  Even  if  I  had  played  a  smash  and  the  ball  had  gone  behind  my\nopponent, I’d perform the chore myself, to get more exercise. The result was a weight loss of 10 kg in\ntwenty days. But I had started to feel dizzy and weak and my trousers were now too loose, so I decided\nit was time to stop. The first meal I had after three weeks on the diet was boiled spinach and broccoli\nand after that I went back to eating normally.\nThe perfect partner\nTo  come  from  such  a  different  background  and  yet  be  able  to  integrate  herself  into  the  more\ntraditional Tendulkar household speaks volumes for Anjali’s character and commitment. Frankly, no\ncredit can be enough for her. She was an exceptional student and could have had an exceptional career.\nBut she decided to stand by me and has been with me every moment over the past two decades and\nmore. There have been occasions when I have been away from home and haven’t seen my kids, Sara\nand Arjun, for months. For example, soon after the 2011 World Cup I suddenly realized that I hadn’t\nnoticed that Arjun was almost my height. (He is in fact taller than me now.) There is no doubt I have\nmissed  out  on  some  really  precious  moments  with  my  family.  Such  separations  are  part  of  a\nprofessional  sportsman’s  life,  of  course,  but  I  was  only  able  to  get  through  them  because  I  always\nknew Anjali was there.\nAt the same time, I knew Anjali appreciated why I was away and was proud of what I was doing.\nShe is the one person I can turn to at all times, for whatever she says is always in my best interests.\nNot only has she given me critical feedback on key decisions; she has taken care of everything on the\ndomestic  front.  Starting  with  the  kids,  my  mother,  extended  family,  finances  and  a  host  of  other\nissues, with Anjali in control I could focus on playing cricket. She is also my emotional rock, someone\nI turn to at every moment of self-doubt. There has never been any pressure on me to return home early\nfrom  my  engagements,  for Anjali  has  always  insisted  that  I  should  get  back  home  only  after  I  have\nfinished work to my satisfaction. Of course I regret that I couldn’t spend more time with her and the\nkids during my cricket career, and I also appreciate more than I can say the understanding and support\nI have received from her and the children at all times. Finally, I have always cherished the advantages\nof having a doctor wife who has shielded me at times when I have been injured in the course of my\ncareer.\n"

            "title": "YEARS OF CONSOLIDATION\n",
            "data": "In March 1992, after returning from the gruelling Australian tour and the World Cup, I badly needed a\nfew weeks of relaxation. Our next international assignment was a tour of South Africa towards the end\nof the year and we had several months off in the interim. Fortunately for me, I managed to spend the\nfirst few days at home. I played tennis-ball cricket with friends and it was terrific to be able to unwind\nin familiar surroundings.\nI  was  playing  downstairs  with  my  friends  one  day  when  Ajit  called  down  from  our  apartment\nbalcony to say that there was a phone call from Yorkshire County Cricket Club and that they wanted\nme  to  play  for  them!  I  came  up  to  take  the  call  and  was  very  excited  at  the  offer.  I  did  not  bother\nasking about the contract and other details and was determined to make the most of this opportunity to\nplay  in  the  County  Championship  in  England.  That  I  would  have  to  cook,  do  my  laundry,  drive  and\nperform  all  the  other  household  chores  never  occurred  to  me  at  the  time.  A  few  days  after  the\nconversation,  the  CEO  of  Yorkshire  CCC,  Chris  Hassell,  came  over  to  India  to  complete  the\nformalities. We met at Thane, a suburb of Mumbai, where I was playing a match. I signed the contract\nat the ground, proud to become Yorkshire’s first overseas-born player in 128 years.\nA Yorkshire lad\nI left for England towards the end of April 1992, right after my nineteenth birthday, and stayed there\nfor three and a half months. It was my first long stint away from home on my own and it wasn’t easy\ncoming from such a different cultural background, but the generosity and openness of my employers\nmade the stay immensely enriching and it was a great learning experience, to put it mildly.\nOne  of  the  first  problems  was  that  I  had  little  idea  of  the  roads  and  had  to  follow  my  team-mate\nRichard Blakey as he drove to the ground. I was not really used to driving in England and often opted\nfor the fastest lane while driving to the ground. There were occasions when I missed an exit and also\nlost  Richard  in  the  process.  It  was  difficult  to  turn  back  and  I  cursed  myself  for  not  staying  in  the\nslowest lane, where it would have been easier to see the exit. There were no mobile phones then and\ngetting lost meant I would be late for practice, which I hated.\nI  had  actually  driven  a  little  in  England  in  1991  when  I  was  there  to  play  a  few  games  of  league\ncricket. Back then I stayed with the former India fast bowler Atul Wassan and he was generous enough\nto give me his car to drive around. He asked me if I had driven before and I assured him that I had\npassed all the tests and had an international licence and was confident of my driving skills. He said the\nkey to driving in the UK was not to use the brake much and just to follow the lanes. However, the very\nfirst day ended in disaster. I was in the fast lane when all of a sudden the car came to a halt. There was\nno power and the car would not restart, and I panicked when I saw a string of cars behind me. I told\nAtul, ‘Gadi start nahi ho raha hai yaar!’ (The car is not starting, my friend!) Atul initially thought I\nwas joking and asked me to accelerate. Anxious, I said to him that I was trying to, but there was no\npower  and  nothing  was  working.  Only  then  did  we  realize  that  we  had  run  out  of  fuel.  Atul\nimmediately asked me to put on the hazard lights and in my state of nervousness it took me ages to\nfind the switch in the unfamiliar car. Finally, Atul put on the hazard lights for me. Somehow we got\nthe car onto the hard shoulder, then we called the AA and after a while a breakdown vehicle arrived.\nAnother  problem  was  my  complete  lack  of  knowledge  of  English  geography,  which  caused  a\nnumber of blunders during my stay in Yorkshire. Some of these I now remember with fondness. One\nsuch  was  to  commit  myself  to  playing  at  opposite  ends  of  the  country  on  consecutive  days.  I  had\nagreed to play in an India–Pakistan festival match in London but had also committed to playing for a\nRest of the World XI versus England at Newcastle the following day. To add to my woes, the India–\nPakistan  match  started  at  6  p.m.  and  finished  close  to  midnight.  I  had  driven  from  Yorkshire  to\nLondon for the early-evening start and by the time the match was over I was exhausted.\nAfterwards the other players were heading back to the hotel in London to relax and they asked me to\njoin them. When I said I had to leave for Newcastle because I was playing there the next day I could\nsee the shock and bewilderment on their faces. I had wrongly believed that it was easy to get from any\npart of England to another in two or three hours. It was only when they told me that it would take a\nminimum  of  six  or  seven  hours  to  drive  there  that  I  realized  the  seriousness  of  the  situation.  I  was\nadvised to leave for Newcastle straight away. I was stumped. I had left Yorkshire at one o’clock that\nafternoon  to  get  down  to  London,  and  here  I  was  at  midnight  getting  ready  to  drive  all  the  way  to\nNewcastle.\nJatin Paranjpe was with me at the time and we set off on the long drive together. Unfortunately, we\nhad little knowledge of the roads and were completely dependent on the signs. To add to our misery,\nwe missed a turn and ended up going south for close to thirty-five minutes when we should have been\ndriving north. It was just one of those nights.\nAfter  driving  for  a  couple  of  hours,  my  eyes  started  to  give  way.  I  asked  Jatin  to  drive  while  I\nnapped to regain a bit of energy. Jatin did so and after a few minutes I took my turn in the driver’s seat\nagain. A coffee break helped and eventually we reached the hotel at 8.15 a.m., only to see the team bus\nabout to leave for the ground. We were both pretty much out of it by then and desperately needed to\nclose our eyes. I walked up to the team manager and explained to him my plight and asked if he could\npossibly  let  me  have  twenty-five  minutes  of  sleep.  I  promised  to  join  the  team  at  the  ground  in  an\nhour. He was most kind and I set the alarm at exactly twenty-five minutes.\nWhen I woke up I didn’t know where I was and felt like a complete zombie. I stumbled out of the\nhotel and made my way to the ground. I was sleepy and tired and was in no physical state to play a\nday’s  cricket.  I  still  find  it  hard  to  believe,  but  somehow  I  managed  to  go  out  and  make  a  hundred.\nAfter  lunch,  however,  I  could  hardly  stay  awake  and  for  the  first  time  in  my  life  I  was  taking  ten-\nsecond  naps  between  overs.  I  was  actually  sleeping  while  fielding  and  don’t  really  know  how  I\nmanaged to get through the rest of the game.\nAs soon as the match was over Jatin and I rushed to the hotel. Our plan was to sleep for a couple of\nhours before joining the rest of the team for dinner. The next thing I remember is waking up in the\nearly  hours  of  the  morning.  My  first  thought  was  that  I  had  missed  dinner.  We  tried  calling  room\nservice  but  no  one  picked  up  the  call.  We  called  Reception  and  were  told  that  at  that  hour  they\ncouldn’t serve us any food. With no hope of food, we drank three glasses of water each and went back\nto bed, setting the alarm for 7 a.m., in plenty of time for breakfast. We did manage to get up in time\nfor breakfast and after eating a hearty meal of eggs and toast went to the ground to resume duty for the\nRest of the World XI. For all the exhaustion, I still managed to score some runs and must say that,\namidst all the chaos, the only thing that was going right was my batting.\nAfter the match Jatin and I decided to drive back to Yorkshire in the evening, so that I could rejoin\nmy  county  the  following  morning.  This  journey  too  was  rather  eventful.  There  were  roadworks\neverywhere as we got out of Newcastle and the speed limit had been brought down to 55 mph from the\nnormal 70 mph. Given that it was fairly late, we decided to follow a police car that was in front of us,\nreckoning that as long as we followed a police car while maintaining a safe distance we would also be\nsafe.\nAfter a while I saw the police car making some sort of gesture to me. The driver had his hand out of\nthe window and had all five fingers stretched out. He then closed his fist before spreading his fingers\nagain. I thought he was asking me to put my lights on full beam and duly followed his instructions. A\nfew minutes later the police car put on its hazard lights and signalled us to stop.\nI  was  confused  but  did  exactly  as  I  was  told.  The  policeman  asked  me  if  I  had  seen  his  earlier\nsignal. I said yes and told him that I had followed his instruction and turned on my lights. He said that\nwasn’t  what  he  had  meant  and  explained  that  the  signal  was  for  me  to  slow  down  because  I  was\nspeeding. The police car was doing 65 mph while the speed limit had been set at 55 mph. As I’d been\nmaintaining the same distance for the last hour and a half, I must have been speeding. He went on to\nsay that the reason he stretched his five fingers twice was to indicate to me that the speed limit was 55\nmph and I should slow down.\nI was taken aback and immediately confessed to my mistake, saying it wasn’t intentional and that I\nwas blindly following the police car, believing it to be the safest option. In the interim the policeman\nhad  seen  the  white  rose  and Yorkshire  CCC  printed  on  my  car  and  asked  what  it  meant.  I  informed\nhim that I played cricket for Yorkshire and it was a car given to me by the county. At this he asked my\nname and queried if I was indeed the first overseas professional to play for Yorkshire. I think it was\nmy identity that earned me a reprieve and I was let off with a warning that I should always keep the\nspeed limit in mind while driving.\nLife lessons\nAt Yorkshire we often played back-to-back matches and it helped me improve my batting a great deal.\nThe  conditions  were  very  different  from  those  back  home  and  I  definitely  matured  as  a  batsman\nduring my time in county cricket. The ball would swing a greal deal more than in India and it allowed\nme to improve my technique and ability to adjust to different conditions. Over the years, the lessons\nlearnt  from  my  stint  at  Yorkshire  continued  to  help  me  whenever  I  toured  England  as  part  of  the\nIndian team.\nSocially  too  it  was  a  good  learning  experience.  The  authorities,  including  the  president  Sir\nLawrence  Byford,  were  extremely  sociable.  The  team  had  a  great  time  and  I  particularly  remember\nsome extremely interesting Sunday club bonding sessions. In one it was decided that everybody had to\nwear towels and a tie without a shirt and meet in the hotel’s convention centre. At first I thought my\nteam-mates were pulling my leg and I wasn’t prepared to dress up without seeing a few of the other\nplayers  do  so.  I  kept  a  close  eye  on  the  lobby  and  only  when  I  saw  a  number  of  my  team-mates\nsporting a towel and tie did I do the same. It turned out to be an eccentric but hilarious evening in the\nend.\nEveryone at Yorkshire knew I was only nineteen and they were always eager to help. This was just\nas well, because things were not at all what I was used to in Mumbai. I had toured England in 1990, of\ncourse, but back then I had been with the Indian team and everything was arranged for us. This time I\nhad to do everything on my own – from organizing my own food to doing the laundry.\nCoping  by  myself  sometimes  caused  me  great  embarrassment.  One  incident  involved  my  first\nattempt  to  use  a  washing  machine.  I  had  no  idea  how  much  detergent  was  needed  and  must  have\nemptied about half a packet into the machine before starting the washing cycle, then I went out. On\nmy  way  back  I  could  see  something  oozing  beneath  my  front  door.  I  was  shocked  at  first  until  I\nremembered that I had left the washing machine on. All the detergent had made it overflow and there\nwas foam everywhere.\nThat was the first and last time I did the laundry on my own. Every other time Solly bhai’s family\nkindly  came  to  my  rescue.  Solly Adams,  who  I  fondly  referred  to  as  Solly  bhai,  was  a  resident  of\nDewsbury in West Yorkshire. I had first met Solly and his wife Mariam in 1990 in the company of\nDilip Vengsarkar. Every Mumbai cricketer who had played league cricket in England had spoken to\nme about Solly bhai’s hospitality and it was natural that I should get in touch with him. His house had\nbecome a refuge for all Indian cricketers in the area and we all looked forward to the delectable food\nwe were served at Solly bhai’s house, particularly the biryani, tandoori chicken, raita and mango lassi.\nIt soon became a ritual for me to visit him three times a week when I was in Yorkshire.\nSolly bhai’s brother Younus and his wife Ruksana were also great hosts and it was from them that I\nlearnt the art of filling the salad bowl. When a few of my friends – Jatin Paranjpe, Mufi and Vinod\nKambli  –  came  to  stay  with  me  in Yorkshire,  we  mostly  survived  on  cheap  fast  food. As  the  only\nmember of the quartet who was earning, I would pay the bills and, with limited resources, fast food\nwas the most affordable option. We would eat out at KFC, Burger King and the like, but the all-you-\ncan-eat buffet at Pizza Hut was our favourite. While we could eat as many pizzas as we wanted for a\nfixed price, we could only fill up our salad bowl once. And it was here that the training from Younus\nand Ruksana came in handy. They taught me to use lettuce leaves to construct a wall, so that the size\nof  the  bowl,  which  was  ordinarily  just  two  or  three  inches  tall,  increased  to  five  or  six  inches.  We\ncould then fill it with as much salad as we wanted.\nI  finally  left Yorkshire  for  India  around  mid-August,  to  get  back  in  time  for  the  Duleep  Trophy,\nIndia’s  second  most  important  domestic  competition.  It’s  named  after  Ranjitsinhji’s  nephew\nDuleepsinhji,  who  played  for  England  in  the  early  1930s,  and  features  teams  representing  the\ncountry’s five zones: West, North, South, East and Central, It was suggested that I should play in it\nbefore  we  left  for  what  would  be  a  challenging  tour  of  South  Africa  in  October.  The  Yorkshire\nmanagement was most considerate and allowed me to come back early, thus ending a really fruitful\nand productive time in county cricket.\nIndia in South Africa, November 1992–January 1993\nIt was a historic tour because it was the first time the South Africans had played a Test series at home\nsince returning to the international fold in 1991. They had toured India in November 1991 to end their\ninternational isolation after twenty-one years and in the three one-day internationals showed they were\na very good side. In Allan Donald they had one of the best fast bowlers in the world and he was ably\nsupported by Richard Snell, Brian McMillan, Craig Matthews, Meyrick Pringle, Brett Schultz and a\nhost of other really good bowlers. In South African conditions the fast bowlers would pose a serious\nchallenge.\nThe United Cricket Board of South Africa had made every effort to make the tour memorable. We\nlanded in Durban and were immediately met by the hosts, who put us in open-top cars. There were two\ncricketers in each car and hordes of people lined the road as we made our way to the hotel. I was in a\ncar  with  Pravin  Amre,  a  middle-order  bat  and  another  of  Ramakant  Achrekar’s  students,  and\nremember listening to Kishore Kumar songs all the way to the hotel. It was a fabulous experience.\nWe  played  our  first  tour  game  against  Nicky  Oppenheimer’s  XI  at  his  private  ground  in\nRandjesfontein. It had rained heavily before the start of the game and it looked highly unlikely that we\nwould get any cricket on the day. But I had underestimated our hosts and was totally taken aback to\nsee  what  they  were  pouring  onto  the  pitch  to  dry  it  out.  They  actually  burnt  petrol  on  the  pitch  to\nexpedite  the  drying  process,  something  I  had  never  imagined  could  happen.  That  wasn’t  all.  To  our\nsurprise,  a  couple  of  helicopters  hovered  over  the  ground  to  dry  the  pitch  for  a  good  forty-five\nminutes. As a result of all this effort, the pitch was finally playable and we managed to get a game. I\nmade a hundred and we won the match easily, making a very good start to the tour. Afterwards, the\ntalk in the dressing room was that we would beat the South Africans easily. We carried this sense of\ncomplacency into the next match, where we scored over 500 runs against a Combined Bowl XI after\nbowling them out for 230. The tour was turning out to be a walk in the park.\nThings changed dramatically when we played the South African Board President’s XI at Centurion\non 6 November 1992. We bowled first and, standing at slip, I could see that the ball was not carrying\nthrough to the keeper. Manoj Prabhakar and Subroto Banerjee, a promising medium-fast swing bowler\nwith a terrific sense of humour, opened the bowling for us and neither generated much pace off the\nwicket. Apart from Srinath, who could bowl fast, none of our bowlers could get the ball to carry to the\nkeeper on that slowish track and we felt reasonably happy to get the opposition out for 268.\nAs our innings started we felt confident of batting the opposition out of the game again, but things\ndidn’t  quite  go  according  to  plan.  The  second  over  was  bowled  by  Brett  Schultz  and  he  generated\nserious pace in his very first over; in fact, it was one of the quickest first overs I had seen. This wasn’t\nwhat  we  had  expected  and  within  minutes  the  atmosphere  in  the  dressing  room  had  become  very\nsubdued. The wicket had started to look lively and the batsmen were having all sorts of problems. It\nwasn’t difficult to see that the Test series might not be so easy after all.\nDuring  the  match  it  rained  a  little  and  the  drizzle  had  made  the  outfield  slippery. As  a  nineteen-\nyear-old  full  of  energy,  I  decided  it  would  be  a  good  idea  to  use  the  rain  to  practise  sliding,  at  the\nopposite  end  of  the  ground  from  the  pavilion.  Chamundeshwarnath,  a  former  South  Zone  first-class\nplayer who was playing club cricket there, helped the Indian team in fielding practice and also gave\nme  throw-downs  in  the  nets.  He  was  with  me  and  was  helping  me  with  my  drills.  If  under  normal\ncircumstances  I  was  able  to  slide  for  about  three  or  four  yards,  the  rain  stupidly  encouraged  me  to\nslide a few extra yards each time I chased a ball. In doing so I twisted my ankle and had to be carried\noff the ground. When I went to the hospital to get the injury checked, I was told it would take at least\nfour to five weeks to recover.\nWith the first Test still a week away, I was desperate to play a part in the series and pushed myself\nto get fit as quickly as possible. After a few days, I started to walk but I was still finding it difficult to\nrun.  The  team  management  was  keen  for  me  to  play  because  I  was  batting  well,  but  the  only  way  I\ncould do so was by standing in the slips, where I did not have to do much running about. It eventually\nturned out to be quite embarrassing because there I was, a youngster, standing in the slips while Kapil\nDev, the senior member of the side, was running about in the deep.\nIn  the  first  Test  match  at  Durban,  starting  on  13  November  1992,  we  batted  well  and  remained\ncompetitive throughout the game, which ended in a draw. Pravin Amre scored a fantastic hundred on\ndebut and it was an innings full of character. I, unfortunately, wrote myself into the history books by\nbecoming the first batsman to be given out by the third umpire – the use of TV replays had just been\nintroduced. I had played the ball to point, where Jonty Rhodes was fielding. He was on it in a flash and\nreturned it to the keeper in quick time. Still hampered by the ankle injury, I took a little extra time to\nturn back and, thanks to Jonty’s brilliance, fell short by two or three inches. Just to be sure, umpire\nCyril Mitchley went to the third umpire, Karl Liebenberg, who declared me run out.\nIt was my first taste of Jonty Rhodes’s fielding prowess, something that caused us problems for the\nwhole tour. Jonty was particularly effective in the ODI series and was undoubtedly the best fielder I\nplayed against. His anticipation and reactions were the quickest I have encountered and he managed to\ndry up all the singles around point, cover point and towards third man. On difficult pitches they can be\ncrucial runs and all of a sudden they had been cut off, with Jonty manning the entire area on the off\nside  with  amazing  speed.  He  ran  a  number  of  us  out  and  saved  a  lot  of  runs  every  game,  making  a\nsignificant difference to the outcome of the series.\nThe  other  thing  about  Jonty  was  his  running  between  the  wickets.  In  the  third  match  of  the  ODI\nseries, which we won, Jonty had played a slog sweep off Ravi Shastri to deep square leg, where Kapil\nspilled the catch. In the interim Jonty had completed the first run really fast and had almost made it\nback  to  the  striker’s  end,  only  to  realize  that  his  batting  partner Andrew  Hudson  had  not  made  any\nattempt  to  run  a  second.  To  our  amazement,  Jonty  turned  back  and  almost  made  it  to  the  other  end\nbefore  the  bails  were  dislodged  to  run  him  out.  He  had  all  but  completed  three  runs  in  the  time  the\nnon-striker had managed just one.\nComing back to the Test series, we followed the Durban draw with another good performance in the\nsecond Test at Johannesburg, which started on 26 November. I got a hundred in this game, my fourth\nin Test cricket. It is an innings I remember with great satisfaction. I was not out on 75 at the end of the\nsecond  day  and  had  to  fight  really  hard  on  the  third  morning. Allan  Donald  was  bowling  a  brilliant\nspell and patience was the key to survival. I kept leaving balls outside the off stump and knew I had to\nsee Donald off before I was able to get on with scoring. I played just one cover drive before lunch,\notherwise  it  was  a  battle  of  attrition  and  patience.  That  memorable  contest  against  Allan  Donald\ntypefies what Test cricket is all about for me, making it the pinnacle of all formats of the sport. Here\nwas  a  fast  bowler  propelling  the  ball  at  close  to  150  kph.  For  a  batsman  there’s  nothing  more\nchallenging than really hostile fast bowling in bowler-friendly conditions. You don’t get to play spells\nlike that in domestic cricket and surviving is a true test of a batsman’s calibre.\nAt  Johannesburg,  I  finally  got  to  my  hundred  after  lunch,  facing  270  balls  in  the  innings,  which\nlasted for six and a half hours. With Kumble taking six wickets in South Africa’s second innings, we\nmanaged  to  draw  the  match  and  went  into  the  third  Test  at  Port  Elizabeth  with  all  to  play  for.  The\nother bowler who bowled very well for South Africa was Craig Matthews. He was the most accurate of\nthe lot and bowled a crafty line outside off stump, from where the ball would generally swing away.\nOccasionally he would get one to nip back and it was difficult to play this incoming ball. So much so\nthat almost the whole team ended up with very similar black bruises on our thighs after being hit by\nMatthews. We even joked about it in the dressing room, saying, ‘ Aare isko bhi medal mila hai dekh!’\n(He too has got a medal. Check!)\nUnfortunately, we lost the third Test at Port Elizabeth to the pace and guile of Allan Donald, who\npicked up twelve wickets in the match. We were still in the game at the end of the first innings of both\nteams, but it was Donald’s opening burst in the second innings that made all the difference. We lost\nour  first  six  wickets  for  31  and,  despite  a  brilliant  hundred  from  Kapil  Dev,  we  never  really  had  a\nchance. I got a bad umpiring call and was declared out to Brett Schultz, caught behind, when the ball\nhad actually hit the inside of my thigh. The umpire met me at the end of the game and apologized for\ngetting it wrong. It was understandable, for umpiring is one of the most difficult jobs in cricket and it\nis only human to get things wrong sometimes.\nWe  were  determined  to  level  the  series  in  the  fourth  and  final  Test  match  at  Cape  Town,  which\nstarted  on  2  January  1993.  While  we  failed  to  achieve  that,  we  didn’t  play  badly.  Javagal  Srinath\nbowled  particularly  impressively,  picking  up  six  wickets.  This  time  Allan  Donald  bowled  a  lot  of\novers to me from round the wicket, pitching it short of a length to make the most of the spongy bounce\nCape Town is known for. I decided to try a new approach. He was bowling short and was getting the\nballs to come into my body. I realized that the best way to counter him would be to frustrate him. My\nthinking was simple: if taller guys can use their height to stand up on their toes and get on top of the\nbounce, why shouldn’t the shorter guys use their height to go under the ball. So I decided to change\nmy stance in this match. Normally I used to leave a gap of ten inches to a foot between my feet while\nbatting, but in Cape Town I increased the gap to two and a half feet. This meant I was effectively even\nshorter than normal and could easily get under Donald’s deliveries, forcing him to change the length\nhe was bowling. It proved successful and I managed to bat for more than four and a half hours, facing\n208 balls for my 73, which helped us draw the game.\nIn the ODI series, which for some reason was played between the second and third Tests and which\nfor  the  first  time  was  played  with  two  new  balls,  one  from  each  end,  we  gave  a  good  account  of\nourselves, despite losing the seven-game contest 2–5. Most of the matches were low-scoring and 200\nor thereabouts was considered a competitive score, which seems extraordinary these days.\nWe had lost to South Africa in both formats but I must say I had relished the challenge of playing\nagainst some of the best fast bowlers in the world. Every side faces difficulties away from home and\nat the end of the tough South Africa series we were looking forward to dishing out a few challenges to\nGraham Gooch’s England when they toured India in February–March 1993. Remarkably, it would be\nmy first ever Test series on home soil.\nEngland in India, January–March 1993\nThere’s  nothing  quite  like  playing  in  front  of  home  crowds  and  in  home  conditions.  When  the  first\nTest  at  Eden  Gardens  in  Kolkata  started  on  29  January  1993,  the  enthusiasm  among  the  spectators\nacted as huge motivation. Mohammad Azharuddin, our skipper, who always relished playing at Eden\nGardens, set the tone with a brilliant 182, while I managed a half-century. By the fifth day we needed\njust 34 to win and to my complete amazement 70,000 people had come to the stadium to see us knock\noff the winning runs and take a 1–0 lead in the three-Test series. I remember hitting a short ball from\nPaul Jarvis, the England fast bowler, over square leg to the boundary to win the game.\nBack  in  the  dressing  room  there  was  no  holding  back.  We  really  needed  that  win  after  the\ndisappointment  in  South  Africa  and  it  felt  particularly  great  to  see  the  spinners  come  into  play  in\nconditions that suited their art. The English batsmen I had seen hitting through the line in England in\n1990  were  now  struggling  against  the  turning  ball.  The  boot  was  on  the  other  foot  and  we  were\nenjoying every moment of it. Playing spin in the subcontinent is quite a challenge and England were\nfinding  it  very  difficult.  We  had  a  three-pronged  spin  attack  in Anil  Kumble,  Rajesh  Chauhan  and\nVenkatapathy Raju – a lethal threesome. With the fast bowlers Kapil Dev and Manoj Prabhakar both\nvery able with the bat, we had the flexibility to go in with five bowlers, making our attack look that\nmuch more potent.\nThe second match of the series started in Chennai on 11 February and it was in this match that I got\nmy  first  home  Test  hundred.  The  surface,  a  very  good  track  to  bat  on,  was  hard  with  a  little  bit  of\nbounce.  I  scored  165  and  could  easily  have  gone  on  to  score  a  double  ton  if  I  hadn’t  played  a\ndisappointingly loose shot to Ian Salisbury, the leg-spinner. I had set out to hit the ball over midwicket\nand ended up top-edging it back to the bowler.\nNavjot  Sidhu  also  made  a  century  and  we  posted  a  sizable  total  of  560.  Despite  some  resistance\nfrom Neil Fairbrother in their first innings, England were forced to follow on. Chris Lewis put up a\ngood  fight  in  the  second  innings,  making  his  maiden  century,  but  Kumble  took  six  wickets  and  we\nended  up  winning  the  match  comfortably.  We  headed  to  Mumbai  for  the  third  Test  four  days  later,\nhaving already taken an unassailable 2–0 lead in the series.\nThis was to be my first Test match at the Wankhede Stadium, where I had grown up playing a lot of\nmy  cricket,  and  hence  it  was  a  homecoming  of  sorts.  It  was  the  same  for  Vinod  Kambli,  who  got  a\nspectacular  double  hundred  in  this  match.  England  must  have  been  reasonably  pleased  to  post  their\nbiggest total of the series in their first innings, 347, with Graeme Hick making his highest Test score\nof  178.  Yet  we  posted  an  impressive  591  in  reply,  of  which  I  contributed  78,  and  then  Manoj\nPrabhakar took three quick wickets and the spinners did the rest, handing the English another innings\ndefeat. It’s fair to say that we had successfully put the disappointment of South Africa behind us.\nAnil  Kumble,  who  had  bowled  beautifully  in  all  three  Test  matches,  was  declared  Player  of  the\nSeries. Anil was becoming the match-winner we had been looking for and discipline and rigour were\nthe hallmarks of his craft. He did not turn the ball much but made up for it with great accuracy and\ntenacity. I never saw Anil let up in intensity and have nothing but the highest regard for him, one of\nthe greatest players to have represented India.\nThe ODI series was more closely contested and we went into the last match at Gwalior on 5 March\n1993 needing to win to level the series. Up till then, I had had a mediocre run batting at number five or\nsix. However, at Gwalior I managed to score a quick 34 off thirty balls at a crucial time in the game\nand was involved in a key partnership with Azhar, who scored a brilliant 95 not out as he took us to\nvictory.\nThe England series marked the beginning of a very successful phase in Indian cricket. We followed\nup by beating Zimbabwe in a one-off Test at home and were gradually getting into a healthy winning\nhabit  in  home  conditions.  In  ODIs  we  had  started  winning  close  contests  and  we  went  into  the  next\nmajor one-day tournament – the Hero Cup, also featuring South Africa, Sri Lanka, the West Indies and\nZimbabwe – as one of the favourites.\nTurning my arm over\nNot long before the Hero Cup I played a festival match in Bangalore. When Kiran More, normally a\nwicketkeeper, bowled me a juicy full toss I tried to hit it for six but ended up twisting my wrist. It was\na freakish injury and while I was able to continue batting, I was in serious pain. After a few days the\ninjury  had  still  not  eased  and  it  was  decided  that  I  needed  to  have  an  injection.  This  was  my  first\ncortisone injection and Dr Anant Joshi flew in from Mumbai to Delhi to administer the shot. I was to\nbe  injected  on  my  wrist  very  close  to  the  palm,  and  with  the  Hero  Cup  just  days  away,  I  was\napprehensive about the recovery. The injection, which was pretty painful, was the first of a hundred or\nmore cortisone injections over the course of my career.\nThe  one  match  of  the  Hero  Cup  I  will  never  forget  is  the  semi-final  against  South Africa  on  24\nNovember 1993. We batted first, scoring a very modest 195 in our fifty overs. We knew we needed to\nbowl and field exceedingly well if we were to stop South Africa from making the final. Our bowlers,\nled by Anil, did a very good job and at the end of the forty-ninth over South Africa needed six runs to\nwin.  Having  made  a  match  of  it  despite  scoring  too  few  runs,  we  now  had  to  decide  who  should  be\nentrusted with the task of bowling the all-important final over.\nI volunteered to take the responsibility. I had not bowled on the day and so I thought my bowling\nwould have a surprise element to it. Also, the track had assisted the slower bowlers and Kapil’s pace\nmight have been easier for the South African batsmen to deal with. Then I realized that after fielding\nfor forty-nine overs and in the slightly nippy evening, my body was stiff and my hands were frozen. I\nknew I had to warm up again quickly because there was no second chance. One wide could mean the\nmatch was over.\nThe  first  ball  was  a  good-length  delivery  to  Brian  McMillan,  one  of  the  best  all-rounders  in  the\nworld at the time, who managed a single. But in the process South Africa lost Fanie de Villiers, who,\nin trying to get McMillan back on strike, was run out by a throw from Salil Ankola. Importantly, it\nmeant  that  McMillan  was  at  the  non-striker’s  end  and  the  new  man  was  facing  me.  This  was  my\nopportunity. Allan  Donald,  the  new  batsman,  wasn’t  great  with  the  bat  and  if  I  managed  to  pin  him\ndown  we  definitely  had  a  chance  of  winning  the  contest.  The  key  was  to  keep  the  big-hitting  Brian\nMcMillan away from the strike.\nAs Donald walked to the wicket, I knew he was feeling the tension. I just had to hold my nerve and\nnot try anything fancy. I deliberately bowled slower to him and even tossed one up, giving it a bit of\nspin.  Donald  was  unable  to  cope  with  the  lack  of  pace  and  ended  up  putting  himself  and  his  team\nunder pressure by playing out three dot-balls. He didn’t manage a single till the fifth ball of the over.\nSouth Africa now needed a boundary off the last ball to win. For our part, we just needed to stop the\nboundary and we were in the final.\nThe key to handling pressure situations like these is to keep yourself steady, follow your instincts\nand think clearly. I was aware that there had been occasions in the past when a batsman had got an\ninside edge attempting a huge heave and the ball had beaten the keeper standing up and sped to the\nboundary.  In  such  circumstances  there’s  little  the  bowling  team  can  do.  Remembering  this,  I  asked\nVijay Yadav, our keeper, to stand back, as if to a fast bowler.\nIt’s  difficult  to  believe,  looking  back,  but  McMillan  did  try  a  slog  and  he  did  get  an  inside  edge.\nYadav easily picked up the ball twenty yards back and South Africa could only sneak a single. In the\nmost dramatic of finishes we had managed to win and were in the final. I had conceded only three runs\nin the over and we had won by two runs. The packed Eden Gardens crowd, which numbered close to\n100,000,  turned  hysterical.  Paper  torches  were  lit  all  round  the  stands,  creating  an  unbelievable\natmosphere. I felt a sense of exhilaration and was soon engulfed by my team-mates. It was one of the\nbest one-day internationals I had played in.\nThe other, rather unexpected, contributor to the Indian victory was a mongoose, which kept coming\nonto the ground during the second half of this day-night encounter at the Eden Gardens. It seemed that\nevery  time  the  mongoose  came  on  the  field  the  momentum  shifted  and  the  South  Africans  lost  a\nwicket. While it was just a coincidence, of course, it turned out to be a lucky coincidence for India!\nAfter  such  a  nerve-racking  semi-final,  the  final  was  a  relatively  easy  affair,  with  Anil  running\nthrough the West Indies line-up to give us the title. He bowled brilliantly and finished off with career-\nbest figures of 6–12 as we won the Hero Cup in front of a packed Eden Gardens. To make the victory\neven  sweeter,  I  managed  to  get  the  wicket  of  Brian  Lara.  Getting  Brian  Lara  out  was  interesting\nbecause  Ajit,  who  had  travelled  to  Kolkata  with  me  to  watch  the  semi-final  and  the  final,  had\nmentioned to me in the hotel that I should look to get Brian Lara out if I got a chance to bowl to him,\nand also suggested that I should bowl stump to stump to him. As it happened, I did get a chance to\nbowl to Brian, who had opened the batting for the West Indies. After he had hit me for a few runs, I\nbowled him a delivery slightly outside the off stump, which nipped back in a shade and bowled him.\nDelighted with the wicket, I immediately thought of the discussion I had had with Ajit.\nMy  first  year  of  cricket  on  home  soil  had  gone  really  well.  However,  there  were  still  things  I\ndesperately wanted to do. One was getting my first ODI hundred and another was opening the batting\nfor India in one-dayers.\nIndia in New Zealand, March–April 1994\nIt was the morning of 27 March 1994 and later that day we were playing New Zealand in the second\ngame of a four-match ODI series in Auckland. Navjot Sidhu, our first-choice opener, woke up with a\nstiff  neck  and  was  in  no  position  to  play.  That’s  when  I  went  up  to  Azhar  and  our  manager  Ajit\nWadekar, a former Indian captain and a leading batsman of his time, and pleaded with them to give\nme an opportunity at the top of the order. Why did I think I should open? Well, I had the ability to\nattack  bowlers  and  play  shots  from  the  word  go,  and  in  the  one-day  game,  the  key  was  to  take\nadvantage of the field restrictions in the first fifteen overs. I was sure that I just needed a chance to\nprove  myself.  I  told  Wadekar  Sir  that  if  I  failed  I’d  never  ask  him  again.  In  any  case,  there  was  no\nreserve opener in the team and they had no choice but to experiment with an irregular opener in place\nof  Sidhu.  If  they  put  me  at  the  top,  they  could  still  get  a  middle-order  batsman  to  fill  in  for  me  at\nnumber four or five. After a lot of pleading, they finally agreed.\nNew Zealand scored just 142 batting first, but we still needed to make a good start. As I walked out\nto bat, I felt different in some way. I told myself that this was my big chance to open the batting for\nIndia. I did not want to let down the captain and the coach. Once I was at the wicket I cleared my mind\nand was just intent on hitting the ball hard, come what may. It was one of those days when everything\nfell into place and soon I couldn’t wait for the next delivery. The quicker the better, as far as I was\nconcerned.  I  managed  to  score  82  off  forty-eight  balls,  finally  holing  out  to  the  left-arm  spinner\nMatthew Hart off a leading edge. I had hit fifteen fours and two sixes.\nAfter that I no longer had to plead with Wadekar Sir to allow me to open and I continued to score\nruns  in  that  position  for  the  rest  of  the  series,  which  ended  up  being  tied  2–2.  It  was  no  surprise\nbecause New Zealand at home were always formidable opponents. In this series, I was able to dictate\nterms  to  the  bowlers  and  all  my  plans  were  working  out  well.  For  example,  against  Gavin  Larsen,\nknown to be a bowler who bowled a stump-to-stump line, I came down the wicket a couple of times,\nforcing him to adjust his length. When he bowled short I was waiting for it and promptly dispatched\nthe ball to the stands.\nWith  one  aim  achieved,  I  was  determined  to  accomplish  the  second  as  soon  as  possible.  I  had\nstarted  to  feel  frustrated  and  a  little  embarrassed  at  not  having  scored  a  hundred  in  ODI  cricket.\nHaving  already  played  seventy-odd  games,  it  was  about  time.  The  moment  finally  came  against\nAustralia in Sri Lanka in the Singer World Series in September 1994 and it was more of a relief than\nanything else. So much of getting to a century is in the mind. Once you score one, you know you can\nscore  another  and  the  doubts  aren’t  there  any  more  –  getting  the  first  one  is  the  tricky  bit.  My  first\nODI hundred certainly soothed the nerves and it was an important milestone in my career.\nPlaying against Brian Lara\nWith five years of experience, I was now firmly established in the Indian team and people had started\ncomparing  me  with  other  players  on  the  international  scene  at  the  time.  The  press  love  to  set  up\nrivalries  and  with  a  home  series  against  the  West  Indies  coming  up  at  the  end  of  1994,  it  was\ninevitable that the fans and the media would pit me against Brian Lara.\nWithout doubt Brian Lara is one of the best players to have played this sport. I first met Brian in\nNovember 1990 during a festival match in Toronto between the West Indies and a World XI, which\nwas  played  at  the  SkyDome,  a  stadium  designed  for  Major  League  Baseball.  We  got  along  straight\naway  and  I  enjoyed  talking  to  him  and  listening  to  his  insights.  He  was  a  clear  thinker  and  had  an\nexcellent grasp of the nuances of the game. To add to his unrivalled flamboyance, he also had great\nhands  and  footwork,  making  him  a  champion  batsman  of  our  time.  Brian  was  capable  of  playing  a\nnumber of shots to the same delivery and his ability to adjust at the last moment set him apart. His\ntechnique wasn’t orthodox but that had never mattered to him. He more than made up for it with skill\nand footwork.\nBy  the  time  the  West  Indies  came  to  India  in  November–December  1994,  Brian  was  already  the\npremier batsman of his team. We knew we had to stop Brian from scoring to have a chance in the Test\nseries, but it was easier said than done, and Brian played a very important role for the West Indies in\nthe third and final Test at Mohali. It was his innings of 91 that set the platform for a series-levelling\nWest Indies win. For the visitors, Jimmy Adams too played a crucial part, with 252 runs in the match.\nI had a pretty good series and in the first match at Mumbai I was pleased with my performance in\nthe second innings, scoring 85 after coming in to bat at a precarious 11–3. We won the match by 96\nruns, having managed to get Brian out early in both innings. In the second Test at the VCA stadium in\nNagpur,  I  scored  179  in  our  first  innings.  I  remember  this  innings  for  my  wild  celebrations  after\nscoring the century, something I hardly ever did in my career. In fact, it was an aberration, caused by a\ncombination of factors. I was not out on 81 overnight and started the second day against the second\nnew  ball.  I  hit  Kenneth  Benjamin  for  four  fours  in  the  first  few  overs  and  raced  to  97  in  no  time.\nCourtney Walsh was bowling from the other end and I was trying to get into his mind, to understand\nwhat he was likely to do. I had a feeling he would bowl outside off stump or full if he wanted to get\nme out. On the other hand, he would probably bowl bouncers if he just wanted to keep me quiet. He\nbowled a short ball and that’s when I realized that another one might be coming my way the very next\ndelivery.  I  was  ready.  I  played  the  hook  to  perfection  and  the  ball  sailed  into  the  stands.  It  was  an\nexhilarating way to get to a century and I just couldn’t control my emotions. I pumped my fists and\nscreamed in joy, though none of it was meant for Walsh. It was simply because my plan had come off.\nFacing criticism\nThe story of this series against the West Indies remains incomplete if I don’t talk about the five-match\nODI  series  that  preceded  the  Tests  in  October  and  November  1994.  It  was  played  in  two  parts.  The\nfirst two ODIs were followed by a tri-series, with New Zealand joining India and the West Indies as\nthe third team, before we went back to playing the last three games of the bilateral series.\nIn  both  of  the  first  two  ODIs  against  the  West  Indies,  on  17  and  20  October,  I  was  out  without\nscoring. I didn’t do much better in the first match of the tri-series, on 23 October, making only eight.\nAfter just three failures, a surprising number of people started to find flaws with my game. While they\nmight  have  been  well-intentioned,  it  seemed  that  every  ex-cricketer  I  met  during  the  tri-series  had\nsome advice for me. Everyone was trying to tell me what was wrong with my game, which I found a\nlittle strange.\nYes, I had scored two consecutive ducks, but this reaction was extraordinary. Every performer goes\nthrough lean patches. I was still at ease with myself and knew that with one good score, things would\nfall  back  into  place.  That’s  exactly  what  happened  in  the  final  of  the  tri-series,  when  I  scored  66  at\nEden  Gardens.  That  was  followed  by  three  consecutive  half-centuries  in  the  bilateral  series,\nculminating  in  a  hundred  in  the  final  game  at  Jaipur  on  11  November.  I  ended  up  as  Player  of  the\nSeries.\nHaving won the tri-series and also the five-match ODI series, we had given our fans a lot to cheer\nabout.  Coming  on  top  of  the  Hero  Cup  win  a  year  earlier,  all  these  victories  helped  boost  the\npopularity  of  ODI  cricket  in  India  ahead  of  the  World  Cup,  which  was  being  co-hosted  by  India,\nPakistan and Sri Lanka in 1996. It was set to be a massive event.\nIndia in South Africa 1992–93\n1st Test.

            "title": "WORLD CUP 1996\n",
            "data": "Our  preparations  for  the  World  Cup  began  with  a  training  camp  in  Bangalore  in  January  1996.  For\nsome reason, it had been decided by the management that it would be a good idea for the team to run\nfrom  the  hotel  to  the  Chinnaswamy  Stadium  every  morning,  with  the  team  bus  and  security  cars\ntrailing  behind.  I  still  don’t  understand  the  logic  behind  this  bright  idea  or  why  somebody  came  up\nwith it in the first place. None of us were used to road running and injuries were bound to happen. I\nended up with a sore shin on the very first day, while a number of other guys had problems with their\nbacks and hamstrings.\nA  joke  started  doing  the  rounds  in  the  dressing  room  about  whether  we  would  be  fielding  on  the\nroad or on the cricket field. We were all prepared to run as much as they liked on grass, but there was\nno  point  risking  injuries  by  running  on  hard  roads  just  weeks  before  the  World  Cup. A  few  players\nsuggested  calculating  the  distance  between  the  hotel  and  the  ground  and  running  the  same  distance\ninside  the  stadium  instead.  The  management  listened  to  what  we  had  to  say  and  road  running  was\nquickly abandoned. Our World Cup preparations started in earnest the following morning.\nDuring the camp we would get to the ground by 7 a.m. and stay there till 2 p.m. The sessions were\nlong  and  draining  and  I  made  sure  to  have  a  big  breakfast  to  keep  up  my  energy  levels.  I  was  only\ntwenty-three in 1996 and could digest everything I ate. Every morning I would have four fried eggs\nsunny side up, with ketchup and tabasco sauce, making two sandwiches of the four eggs, which I just\nloved.  The  breakfast  would  keep  me  going  for  hours  and  I  thoroughly  enjoyed  the  long  training\nsessions. In the evenings we spent time in the pool or in the gym and soon all the players were looking\nforward  to  the  tournament.  No  team  had  won  the  cup  on  home  soil  and  it  was  our  chance  to  make\nhistory.\nGroup stages, February–March 1996\nOur first match was against Kenya at Cuttack in Odisha in Eastern India on 18 February and we won\nthe match comfortably. I scored a hundred and was Man of the Match. We then moved on to Gwalior\nin  the  west  of  the  country  to  play  the  West  Indies  three  days  later,  confident  of  sustaining  the\nmomentum. While February in the east of India can be nippy, in the west the temperatures can touch\n30  degrees  during  the  day.  I  had  a  fever  the  night  before  the  West  Indies  game  but  still  played  and\ncontributed 70 to our victory, which was set up by some fine bowling by Prabhakar and Kumble once\nagain.  Early  on  in  my  innings  Courtney  Browne,  the  West  Indies  wicketkeeper,  dropped  a  skier  at\nshort square leg and I was able to make the most of my reprieve.\nHaving  won  our  first  two  games,  we  played Australia  in  Mumbai  on  27  February,  determined  to\nupstage  the  tournament  favourites. Australia  batted  well  and  put  up  a  competitive  258,  riding  on  a\nbrilliant  innings  from  Mark  Waugh,  the  younger  of  the  Waugh  twins,  who  scored  126.  We  did  not\nbegin the chase well and lost two early wickets to Damien Fleming, who bowled well throughout the\ntournament. That’s when I tried to counter-attack, to get on top of Glenn McGrath and Fleming.\nI managed to establish control and was going really well until the Australians gave the ball to Mark\nWaugh to have a go with his off-spin. I immediately picked up a couple of runs to square leg, followed\nby a sweep for four. As I’d hoped, the deep midwicket fielder was moved slightly towards square leg.\nSpace  at  midwicket  meant  I  could  now  go  over  the  top  for  a  boundary.  Seeing  me  jump  out,  Mark\nWaugh bowled a wide ball. I couldn’t reach it and was out stumped for 90. I have to admit I had been\nout-thought. It was a key moment in the game and we soon lost control amid a flurry of wickets. It\nwas dispiriting to lose the match from a winning position.\nLooking after my interests\nAn odd thing happened during the break between innings in that Australia game. At the time, I was\nperhaps the only Indian player who was playing without a bat sponsor. Most players had ‘Four Square’\nor  ‘Wills’  on  their  bats,  but  my  determination  not  to  endorse  a  tobacco  brand  meant  I  was  playing\nwithout a bat sticker. A few months before the tournament started, a leading multinational, which had\njust entered India, had approached me but talks had not progressed much. I had quoted an amount to\nthem  to  which  they  did  not  agree.  I  was  therefore  surprised  when,  in  the  middle  of  the  game,  the\nmanaging director of this company came over to meet me and suggested that if I put his company’s\nsticker on my bat there and then, they would pay me any amount I wanted.\nI turned down the offer. I was clear I wanted no distractions in the middle of a tournament. I did not\nwant an alien element on my bat, something I had not come to terms with, to catch my eye while I was\nbatting. It might have affected my rhythm. I said I would put a sticker on my bat when I wanted to and\nnot  when  I  was  asked  to  do  so.  I  had  done  well  without  a  bat  sticker  up  till  then  and,  like  most\nsportsmen (though not all care to acknowledge it), I was superstitious about such things. I did not want\nto risk making changes when I was batting well. The bat sticker could wait.\nTowards the closing stages of the tournament, my friend and manager Mark Mascarenhas, head of\nthe  sports  management  company  WorldTel,  mentioned  to  me  that  he  had  lined  up  MRF,  the  well-\nknown  Indian  car  tyre  brand,  as  a  bat  sponsor  but  the  deal  would  only  come  into  effect after  the\ntournament.  Mark,  who  was  based  in  Connecticut  and  had  made  a  name  for  himself  by  winning  the\ntelevision  rights  of  the  1996  World  Cup,  knew  my  concerns  well  and  never  pushed  me  into  doing\nanything  against  my  wishes.  His  ability  to  understand  and  appreciate  my  issues  made  him  a  really\nspecial person. Mark was more a friend than a manager and I was able to trust him fully with all my\nneeds. While he changed the nature of player endorsements in cricket by bringing a string of major\ncorporates to the table, he did so without ever forcing a particular endorsement on me.\nI first met Mark in Sri Lanka in 1995 and it was Ravi Shastri who introduced us. Ravi said to me\nthat here was a man who could shake things up and had a very interesting proposition for me. As soon\nas I met him I was impressed by his professionalism and attention to detail. Mark never left anything\nto  chance.  We  were  really  close  and  even  went  on  a  couple  of  family  holidays  together.  On  one  of\nthese holidays, to Coonoor in South India, we had a fantastic time eating all the local delicacies and\nplaying golf. Mark was another foodie and I have fond memories of the many fantastic meals we had\ntogether in his house in Connecticut in 1998 when I spent a week there. I was totally shocked when I\nfirst  heard  about  his  fatal  car  accident  at  Kharbi,  not  far  from  Nagpur  in  central  India  in  2002,  and\nmust  say  I  lost  a  very  close  friend  and  confidant.  We  worked  wonderfully  well  together  and  it  is\nimpossible to fill the void created by his untimely death.\nAfter Mark was gone a number of agents approached me and expressed an interest in managing my\naffairs. However, my relationship with Mark was such that it never occurred to me to leave WorldTel.\nAnd I am happy to say I have been proved right, with Vinod Naidu, my current manager and friend,\ntaking  care  of  my  affairs  for  a  decade  and  more,  first  on  behalf  of  WorldTel  and  then  on  behalf  of\nWSG (World Sport Group). I first met Vinod in Sharjah in 1998 and then in London over a delicious\nlunch at my favourite Thai restaurant, Patara, when Mark introduced the two of us. It was after Mark’s\nuntimely demise that Vinod and I started working closely together. We spoke to each other regularly\nand, like Mark, Vinod soon came to understand and respect my concerns. It was always clear to him\nthat my cricket was my top priority. Between Mark and Vinod, I have been lucky to have two great\npeople to work with. In fact, it would perhaps not be wrong to say that I have spent more days with\nVinod than anyone else in the professional realm over the last decade and I have enjoyed every bit of\nit. Vinod knows me inside out and has been a constant presence whenever I needed him. To spend so\nmuch time away from his family in order to manage my interests is evidence of his commitment to his\nprofession, and his is another friendship I deeply cherish.\nPakistan again\nThe quarter-final against Pakistan on 9 March 1996 was by far the biggest match of the World Cup.\nThere was tremendous security around the team hotel and we knew that the nation would be watching.\nThat  was  not  so  unusual  for  an  India–Pakistan  match,  but  the  World  Cup  had  added  a  further\ndimension to this particular knock-out encounter. On the day of the match we reached the ground early\nand  found  the  atmosphere  at  the  Chinnaswamy  Stadium  to  be  truly  unbelievable.  The  stadium  was\npacked hours before the game and the crowd was loud and boisterous.\nWe  batted  first  and  I  was  the  first  to  get  out  for  31  to Ata-ur-Rehman,  the  Pakistan  fast  bowler,\ntrying to steer the ball to third man. Navjot Sidhu, who opened the batting with me, batted well for his\n93 and Ajay Jadeja played a fantastic cameo towards the end, scoring 45 off twenty-five balls to get us\nto a very respectable 287 in our fifty overs.\nPakistan  started  brightly  in  response  and  raced  to  80  in  their  first  ten  overs.  We  badly  needed  a\nwicket  to  keep  the  scoring  in  check  and  that’s  when  a  famous  incident  took  place  involving Aamer\nSohail, the Pakistan opener, and Venkatesh Prasad, our fast-medium bowler. Sohail had hit Venky for\na  boundary  towards  point  and  suggested  rather  aggressively  that  that  was  where  he  wanted  to  keep\nVenky all day. He waved his bat towards the boundary and said a number of rather rude things. Venky,\nunderstandably angry, bowled him with his very next ball. It was sweet revenge. Having got his man,\nit was now his turn and he showed Aamer Sohail the way to the dressing room.\nThe team was pumped up after this incident and we soon took control of the match. Prasad picked\nup two more crucial wickets and Ajay Jadeja and I bowled ten reasonably tight overs between us in the\nmiddle, while Kumble chipped in with three wickets. In what turned out to be his final international\ninnings, Javed Miandad was run out for 38, ending a glorious career for Pakistan. Despite some good\nlate hitting by wicketkeeper Rashid Latif, which caused us a bit of a panic, we were on the ascendancy\nthroughout and in the end won the match fairly comfortably, by 39 runs, prompting celebrations all\nover the country.\nOn our way back to the hotel we could see people lining the streets and they were throwing garlands\nand  flowers  at  the  team  bus.  In  the  hotel  too  we  were  being  treated  differently.  We  stayed  on  in\nBangalore for one extra day and spent a relaxed few hours in the pool the next afternoon. We could\nsense that the staff were trying to please us and were looking at us differently. They were looking after\nour every need and when somebody ordered prawns, three different varieties were served, all on the\nhouse. We were being treated like royalty and it felt wonderful to see the country so happy and proud.\nThings fall apart\nWe were due to play Sri Lanka in the semi-final at Eden Gardens on 13 March. We arrived in Kolkata\ntwo days before and the first thing that struck us on landing at the airport was the security. There were\ncommandos everywhere and no fans were allowed near the hotel lobby. This was no ordinary match.\nSomeone had mentioned to us that the surface at Eden Gardens had been relaid with soil brought\nover  from Australia.  The  first  look  at  the  surface  seemed  to  support  this  statement,  with  the  pitch\napparently  hard  and  firm.  In  fact,  it  did  look  like  a  typical Australian  wicket.  On  that  basis,  it  was\nunanimously decided that we should field first if we won the toss, particularly because Sri Lanka had\nchased  very  well  throughout  the  tournament.  Their  openers,  Sanath  Jayasuriya  and  Romesh\nKaluwitharana, had been going for the bowling in the first fifteen overs and had given them fantastic\nstarts in most matches. They had beaten us in the pool stage of the competition and it was important to\ntake early wickets and put them under pressure.\nWe won the toss and put the Sri Lankans in and got off to a great start, picking up Sanath for one\nand  Kalu  for  zero.  They  both  got  out  playing  cut  shots  to  third  man,  vindicating  our  belief  that  the\nwicket  was  hard  and  firm.  It  was  only  when  I  came  on  to  bowl  that  I  realized  we  had  misread  the\nwicket. The ball started to hold up and was stopping on the batsmen. The top layer might have been\nfirm enough, but immediately below the surface it was loose. It would clearly not last the full hundred\novers and it became even more important to keep Sri Lanka down to a manageable score. Though we\nmanaged to restrict Sri Lanka to 251 in their fifty overs, that proved far too many in the end.\nWhen it was our turn to bat the wicket had started doing all sorts of things. The ball was turning and\nholding up and batting was extremely difficult. Opening, I scored 65 but got out rather strangely to a\nball from Sanath Jayasuriya. He was bowling left-arm orthodox spin and the ball hit my pad and rolled\noff to the on side. I thought there was a quick single and stepped out of the crease. Too late, I saw that\nthe ball had stopped very close to Kaluwitharana, the keeper, and there was no way I could finish the\nrun, but by then it was too late. He dislodged the stumps in a flash and I didn’t bother waiting for the\nthird  umpire’s  decision  because  I  knew  I  was  out.  It  was  a  long  and  frustrating  walk  back  to  the\npavilion and I could sense it would not be easy for the batsmen who followed.\nSure enough, we soon lost wickets in a heap, handing Sri Lanka the game. The crowd, desperate for\nan Indian victory, grew increasingly restless and disrupted the game by throwing things onto the field.\nBy then, however, the match was all over. Our World Cup dream lay shattered and there was a deathly\nsilence in the dressing room.\nThis time the journey from the ground to the hotel was painful and when we reached the hotel we\nrealized  that  everything  had  changed.  We  were  made  to  feel  as  if  we  had  done  something  seriously\nwrong. There was no doubt we had let our fans down, but we were hurting as much as anybody. It was\na long and difficult night as we sat around picking over the way the match had played out.\nWe left Kolkata by the first available flight the following morning and I still found it difficult to\naccept  that  Sri  Lanka  and  not  India  would  be  travelling  to  Pakistan  to  play  in  the  World  Cup  final\nagainst Australia. We had done so well to win the quarter-final against Pakistan, the high point of our\nWorld  Cup.  Personally,  I  had  had  a  good  tournament  and  ended  up  with  the  most  runs  in  the\ncompetition – 523, with two centuries and three half-centuries – but that was of little consolation. Our\nbiggest mistake was misreading the Eden Gardens pitch. That is what cost us the game.\nIndian cricket was not going through a good phase. With the World Cup dream over, team morale\nwas low and we had little time to recover before a difficult tour of England, which we lost 1–0, though\nwe  did  discover  two  superb  talents  in  Rahul  Dravid  and  Sourav  Ganguly  along  the  way.  Though  I\nscored  a  couple  of  centuries  in  this  series,  at  Edgbaston  and  Trent  Bridge,  and  Sourav  scored  two\nconsecutive hundreds, on debut at Lord’s and at Trent Bridge, we weren’t able to make our way back\nafter losing the first of the three Tests. The England bowlers, led by Chris Lewis, Dominic Cork and\nAlan  Mullally,  did  well  throughout  the  series  and  run-scoring  was  never  easy.  Nasser  Hussain,  the\nEngland skipper, also had a good series, leading from the front all the way.\nOff the pitch, one incident from this tour is difficult to forget. Sourav Ganguly and Navjot Sidhu\nwere travelling on the Tube in London when a few young guys, who’d probably had a bit too much to\ndrink,  boarded  the  train.  For  some  reason  they  started  making  gestures  at  Sourav  and  Navjot  and\neventually one of them threw a beer can at Navjot, who promptly stood up to confront them. It turned\nugly and a fight ensued, until the train reached the next station, where their attackers staggered off –\nbut then one of them came back onto the train and started waving a gun at Navjot. At this, Sourav’s\nfirst reaction was to drop to the ground and cover his face in fright, but then he started pleading with\nthe  boy  and  dragged  Navjot  away  as  quickly  as  he  could.  Looking  back  at  the  incident,  it  seems  a\nfunny scene in some ways, but it must have been pretty scary at the time!\nSoon  after  returning  to  India  after  a  generally  disappointing  tour  of  England  on  the  field,  I  was\nmade captain of India at the age of twenty-three, replacing Azhar, who had been captain since 1990. It\nwas time for the team to make a fresh start and get back to winning ways as soon as possible.\nIndia in the 1996 World Cup\n6th match.

            "title": "CAPTAINCY – THE FIRST STINT\n",
            "data": "Captaining India is undoubtedly a great honour, and it was a job I felt ready for at that point in my\ncareer.  I  had  captained  Mumbai  and  led  them  to  victory  in  the  Ranji  Trophy  in  1995–96.  In  all,  I\ncaptained Mumbai in sixteen out of the thirty-eight Ranji Trophy matches I played in, and I continued\nto do well as a batsman in these games, scoring at an average of 99.53. I had also captained West Zone\nin  the  Duleep  Trophy,  so  it  wasn’t  an  altogether  new  experience.  Yet  captaining  India  is\nfundamentally different, with its own particular challenges.\nFirst,  there  is  the  need  to  cope  with  the  demands  of  the  non-stop  media  machine.  The  Indian\ncaptain’s  every  move  is  headline  news  and  it  was  no  easy  task  to  protect  myself  from  the  constant\nmedia glare. More important, perhaps, was learning how to deal with the selection committee and the\npractice of zonal representation associated with it.\nIn India the committee consists of five selectors, one from each zone: West, North, South, East and\nCentral.  Zonal  representation  sometimes  resulted  in  selectors  pushing  players  from  their  particular\nzone  and  in  my  first  stint  as  captain  the  team  undoubtedly  suffered  as  a  consequence.  There  were\noccasions when I wasn’t given the team of my choice and did not get particular players I asked for.\nFor me, the priority was always the Indian team. For some of the selectors, however, things may have\nbeen different. I felt there were other factors dictating team selection and at times I felt disappointed\nafter selection committee meetings.\nA promising start\nMy first match as captain was against Australia at the Kotla in New Delhi in October 1996, and we\nwere keen to bounce back after the series defeat in England in the summer. We also needed to win the\nTest  to  keep  our  amazing  home  Test  record  intact.  We  managed  to  do  so,  with  Nayan  Mongia,  our\nwicketkeeper and stand-in opener, scoring a remarkable 152. It wasn’t a bad start as skipper.\nUnusually, Australia had travelled all the way to India just to play a single Test, which was intended\nto mark the inauguration of the Border–Gavaskar Trophy, named after two of world cricket’s greatest\nicons. At least there was a good reason for that one-off game; at other times it was a little difficult to\nunderstand the thinking behind some of our shorter tours. A couple of years earlier, for example, we\nwent all the way to New Zealand for one Test match and four ODIs, with no practice games, and that\nwas considered a tour of New Zealand! We also played our fair share of two-Test series over the years\nand they are not altogether satisfactory either – you blink four times and a two-Test series is over!\nNext on the horizon was a home Test series against South Africa, which was preceded by another\none-day  tournament,  the  Titan  Cup,  involving  India,  Australia  and  South  Africa.  It  was  no  small\nachievement to beat Australia and South Africa, two of the best teams in the world at the time, on our\nway  to  the  title.  In  the  final  at  the  Wankhede  on  6  November,  I  scored  67  in  our  modest  220,  with\nJadeja adding 43, and then it was all down to Anil Kumble, who took four wickets as we bowled the\nSouth Africans  out  for  185,  winning  the  match  by  35  runs.  It  was  a  very  welcome  victory  after  our\ndisappointing loss to Sri Lanka in the World Cup semi-final and it was particularly satisfying for me,\nbecause I had experimented with something radically different as captain.\nAfter Srinath and Venkatesh Prasad had bowled good first spells and Anil had picked up a couple of\nwickets,  I  had  to  turn  to  Robin  Singh,  our  all-rounder,  for  the  fifth  bowler’s  quota.  Robin  bowled\nmedium pace and was extremely accurate. I decided to go with a four–five field. In an ODI, it is very\nunusual, with a medium-pacer operating, for there to be only four fielders on the off side and five on\nthe on. I had no deep point and had fielders at third man, short point, cover and long off. On the on\nside I had fielders at fine leg, short square leg, short midwicket, deep square leg and long on. I asked\nRobin  to  bowl  stump-to-stump  and  make  sure  not  a  single  ball  was  pitched  outside  the  off  stump,\notherwise the South Africans would pick off singles to third man. Three or four singles an over would\nreally  ease  the  pressure  on  them  in  a  relatively  low-scoring  contest.  I  wasn’t  worried  about  Robin\nbowling a leg-stump wide, just as long as he didn’t pitch the ball outside off stump. I was confident\nthat the South Africans were not prepared for this strategy. Robin did his job well. He bowled his full\nquota  of  ten  overs,  giving  away  only  40  runs  and  also  picking  up  the  important  wickets  of  Hansie\nCronje and Daryll Cullinan.\nThe  Test  series  that  followed  the  Titan  Cup  was  always  going  to  be  fiercely  competitive.  South\nAfrica were one of the better teams at the time and had fast bowlers of the calibre of Allan Donald and\nFanie de Villiers and batsmen of the class of Cronje, Gary Kirsten, Daryll Cullinan and Jonty Rhodes.\nThe first match of the series at Ahmedabad started on 20 November 1996 and was a great contest, with\nmultiple twists and turns. After we were bowled out for a modest 223 in the first innings, South Africa\nmanaged a handy 21-run lead. It was a good lead in the context of what seemed likely to be a low-\nscoring game and we had to bat well in the second innings to set them a reasonable target. We faltered\nand left South Africa needing just 170 to win in a little under two days.\nThe game wasn’t lost yet, however. There was a lot of wear and tear on the pitch by the end of the\nthird day and we knew that 170 might prove tricky on that surface. We were playing two leg-spinners\nin Anil Kumble and Narendra Hirwani and a left-arm spinner in Sunil Joshi. The South Africans would\nundoubtedly expect me to attack them with spinners on a crumbling pitch. Instead, I decided to use\nJavagal Srinath, because Sri, with his extra pace, could also get the ball to reverse-swing. Swing at a\ngood pace is very difficult to deal with and in no time Srinath had given us a dream start, reducing the\nSouth Africans to 0–2.\nAfter his successful short opening burst, I rested Srinath for a while before bringing him back for\nanother long spell. I kept talking to him to check if he was feeling tired. He was bowling beautifully\nand had the batsmen in all sorts of trouble. I put Sunil Joshi on at the other end to keep the batsmen in\ncheck  and  not  concede  too  many  runs.  I  asked  Sunil  to  pitch  the  ball  in  the  rough  outside  the  left-\nhanders’ off stump and keep them tied down to one end. This was to allow Srinath to bowl to the right-\nhanders,  as  reverse  swing  was  more  effective  against  right-handed  batsmen.  This  move  paid  real\ndividends. Sunil managed to stem the run flow while from the other end Srinath picked up wickets at\nregular intervals.\nAt  no  time  during  the  chase  were  South  Africa  in  with  a  chance.  We  kept  up  the  pressure  and\nmanaged  to  bowl  them  out  for  105  in  just  thirty-nine  overs,  recording  a  famous  victory.  It  was  the\nhigh  point  of  my  captaincy;  the  plan  to  use  Srinath  from  one  end  had  worked  really  well.  Hansie\nCronje  walked  up  to  me  after  the  game  and  confessed  that  he  had  been  caught  off-guard.  He  had\nexpected me to employ spinners and had a strategy in place to negotiate the turning ball on a wearing\npitch. He did not have a plan for Srinath, and by the time he had come to terms with our tactics the\nmatch was over.\nThe other thing I tried out in that Test match for the first time, something that served India well for\na decade and a half, was to get Rahul Dravid to bat at number three and Sourav Ganguly at five, which\nwas not an obvious decision at the time. Both had had great starts to their careers in England batting in\nother positions. Sourav had scored two consecutive hundreds batting at number three. In his third Test\nagainst Australia, which was the first of my captaincy, he once again batted in that position and scored\n66 in the first innings and was unbeaten on 21 in the second. He was full of confidence and was keen\nto continue batting at three. Rahul too had scored consecutive fifties in England in his first two Tests\nand was looking good at number five. However, I felt that by changing the batting order I could get the\nbest out of each of them in the long run.\nSourav  was  a  boundary-hitter  and  liked  playing  his  shots  from  the  start  of  his  innings.  He  was\nflamboyant and more attacking and I felt his style was more suited to number five. Rahul on the other\nhand played within himself at the start of his innings and was comfortable leaving a lot of deliveries\noutside  the  off  stump.  That’s  an  important  ability  for  a  number-three  batsman.  The  two  had  very\ndifferent strengths and I knew that both were terrific players and had the talent to serve India for many\nyears. With Rahul at three and Sourav at five, I felt the team would have a better balance, especially in\noverseas  conditions.  Though  we  reverted  to  Sourav  at  three  and  Rahul  at  five  for  the  deciding  third\nTest  of  this  series  and  the  first  two  Tests  in  South  Africa  shortly  afterwards,  we  repeated  the\nexperiment in the third and final Test of that series at Johannesburg in January 1997. It worked very\nwell and became a permanent fixture of India’s batting for over a decade.\nIn the second Test of the home series at Eden Gardens at the end of November 1996, South Africa\nbeat  us  comfortably,  with  Lance  Klusener  and  Gary  Kirsten  playing  well  for  the  visitors.  Klusener\ntook  eight  wickets  on  debut  and  Gary  scored  hundreds  in  both  innings.  One  of  South Africa’s  most\nprolific opening batsmen, Gary had the remarkable ability to pick up singles at will with a nudge into\nthe gap between midwicket and square leg. This made him an extremely difficult batsman to bowl to.\nA fierce competitor, he is someone I had the highest respect for as an opponent.\nWe went to Kanpur for the third Test with the series level. Azhar was in commanding form in the\nsecond innings, remaining undefeated on 163, and once we had managed to set South Africa a target of\nover 450 we knew we were in control. We bowled South Africa out for 180, winning the Test by 280\nruns and the series 2–1. To beat Australia and South Africa in my first two series as captain was the\nbest start I could have hoped for, and when we left for South Africa in December 1996 we were a team\nbrimming with confidence.\nIndia in South Africa, December 1996–February 1997\nThe planning for the return series was not the best. We landed in South Africa on 19 December and\nplayed just one practice game before the first Test match in Durban on Boxing Day. On a tour like that\nyou really need at least two or three practice games and close to two weeks of acclimatization to be\ncompetitive. The conditions are so different from those in India that players have to have that time to\nget used to the seam movement and the bounce. Balls that hit the bottom half of the bat in India come\nat heights close to the bat handle in South Africa.\nWe  lost  the  Durban  Test  miserably,  bowled  out  by  the  South African  fast  bowlers  for  66  in  the\nsecond  innings  in  just  thirty-four  overs.  It  was  a  demoralizing  loss  and  I  had  never  experienced\nanything like it before. South Africa proved superior to us in all aspects of the game and we were left\nwith a huge amount of work to do ahead of the second Test at Cape Town.\nTo add to my problems, I had injured myself in Durban while bowling and the injury was taking a\nfew days to heal. It happened when I decided to bowl to Andrew Hudson just before lunch on the first\nday.  I  thought  I  would  run  in  slowly  and  bowl  him  an  unexpected  bouncer,  hoping  to  induce  a  top\nedge. In doing so, I pulled a muscle in my side. The pain was surprisingly acute and I had to go to the\nhospital during the lunch break to have three cortisone injections. Even when I rejoined the team at the\nground I was still extremely sore and found it difficult to run or bend.\nThe second Test started on 2 January 1997, so there were only a few days for the team to recover\nand regroup. It was never going to be enough to cope with a really good South African side. In Allan\nDonald and Shaun Pollock, the South Africans had two of the best fast bowlers in the world, and they\ncomplemented each other beautifully in home conditions. While Donald was fast, Pollock could swing\nthe ball both ways and was a master of his craft. Nevertheless, we did manage to show some signs of\ncompetitiveness in Cape Town and both Azhar and I got hundreds in the first innings.\nI went in to bat towards the end of the second day and was unbeaten on one at the end of play, with\nthe  team  score  on  29–3.  The  following  morning  I  was  practising  against  throw-downs  ahead  of  the\ngame and tried shuffling back and across to a few of the balls. It felt really good and I even timed the\nballs well. Something in me said that I should employ the back-and-across movement that day. I did\nso and found that, even when the bowlers were bowling at close to 150 kph, I still had plenty of time.\nNormally  I  would  stand  just  outside  my  leg  stump  while  taking  guard,  but  at  Cape  Town  I  was\nstanding a good few inches outside to accommodate the shuffle. I ended up making 169. I always felt\nthat I needed to be comfortable in my head before I focused on technique. If I wasn’t comfortable to\nstart with, fretting about technique would not do much for my batting.\nThe other incident I remember from the Cape Town Test and which I thoroughly enjoyed involved\nAllan Donald and the Indian medium-fast bowler Dodda Ganesh. Donald, who was in top form in that\nseries, had no patience with lower-order batsmen and was frustrated to see Ganesh hanging around. As\nDodda  faced  his  onslaught  fearlessly,  Allan  started  mouthing  words  at  him.  For  three  consecutive\ndeliveries Dodda was all over the place but luckily for him did not lose his wicket. At the end of the\nover Allan went up to Dodda and told him what he thought of him in no uncertain terms. Dodda’s face\nremained impassive.\nI witnessed all this from the non-striker’s end. When Allan came to fetch his cap from the umpire, I\ntold him, ‘Allan, Dodda only knows a local Indian language called Kannada. I find it difficult enough\nto communicate with him myself, so how can he understand your abuse in English? If you want to get\nto him, speak to him in Kannada.’ This made Allan even more irritated. He almost snatched his cap\nfrom the umpire and, making wild gestures with his hands, stomped off to his fielding position.\nBy  the  end  of  the  Cape  Town  match  the  players  were  much  more  used  to  the  conditions  and  this\naugured well for us going to Johannesburg for the third Test. We were taking the game very seriously,\neven though it was a dead rubber. We played well from the start and Rahul Dravid, batting at number\nthree for the first time in the series, scored a fantastic hundred. He played the fast bowlers late and\nhelped us to a position of strength. Sourav too batted extremely well at number five and we scored 410\nin our first innings, which put South Africa under pressure for the first time in the series. The bowlers\nfollowed up with a good effort to give us a handy first-innings lead.\nIn  our  second  innings  it  was  once  again  Rahul  and  Sourav  who  did  the  business.  We  could  sense\nvictory and were buoyed by the opportunity. Our bowlers prised out the South African top order fairly\nquickly.  Even  when  there  was  a  partnership  between  Daryll  Cullinan  and  Lance  Klusener  for  the\neighth wicket, we knew we were within striking distance and just needed to keep plugging away.\nWe finally got our breakthrough, in the form of Klusener, and were just two wickets away from a\nhard-earned victory when the skies opened up. It was a torrential downpour and it soon became clear\nthat we had lost a great opportunity to win a Test match in South Africa.\nI  was  distraught.  We  had  done  everything  we  could  to  win  the  match  and  here  we  were  being\ndeprived by the rain. I felt cheated by the forces of nature. I went to the umpires as soon as the rain\nstopped and said we were ready to play even if the outfield was a little wet, but they were within their\nrights to say that they couldn’t permit a restart unless the conditions were fit to play. The Test series\nended  2–0  in  favour  of  South Africa,  but  that  scoreline  didn’t  reveal  just  how  close  we  had  been  to\nmaking it 2–1. It left me disconsolate and in my disappointment I locked myself in the bathroom and\njust cried.\nThe  other  disappointment  in  this  match  was  that  VVS  Laxman,  then  a  youngster,  fractured  his\nfinger and was faced with having to go back to India. Distressed, Laxman was sitting in one corner of\nthe dressing room in tears. I tried to console him, saying that injuries happen, but that he shouldn’t\nworry  too  much  about  them  as  he  had  a  long  career  ahead  of  him.  In  hindsight  it  was  a  prophetic\nstatement!\nIndia in the West Indies, March–April 1997\nIndia had not won a series in the Caribbean since 1971 and I looked on this tour as a major opportunity\nto leave the disappointment of South Africa behind. The conditions were different again from those in\nSouth Africa, and we needed to adjust quickly. However, our preparations suffered a serious jolt when\nSrinath, our leading fast bowler, was ruled out of the tour because he needed shoulder surgery. Abey\nKuruvilla, a tall fast-medium bowler from Mumbai, performed admirably as his replacement, but the\nsituation illustrates a very serious problem I faced in South Africa and subsequently in the Caribbean.\nOn tours like that, I believed we really needed three quality fast bowlers but unfortunately I never\nhad more than two. In South Africa, Abey Kuruvilla was not even part of the squad. Even when I was\ndesperate to have him, the selectors refused to include him. After making his Ranji Trophy debut in\n1991, Abey had played five seasons of first-class cricket by then and would have been a handy bowler\nin South Africa. As it was, after good opening spells from both Srinath and Prasad, we failed to sustain\nthe momentum. In the West Indies, we would once again rue the absence of a quality third seamer.\nDespite losing Srinath, we played well enough in the first two Tests in March 1997, at Sabina Park\nand  Port-of-Spain.  Both  matches  ended  in  hard-fought  draws  and  for  once  it  seemed  that  we  had\nmanaged  to  adjust  to  the  conditions,  with  our  batting  looking  solid  against  the  West  Indian  pace\nquartet  of  Curtly Ambrose,  Mervyn  Dillon,  Ian  Bishop  and  Franklyn  Rose.  By  the  time  we  went  to\nBarbados for the third match of the five-Test series on 27 March, I was feeling confident that we could\ndo something special.\nWe started well at the Kensington Oval and managed to bowl out the West Indians for under 300,\nthanks to some fine bowling from Venkatesh Prasad, with 5–82, and despite a Shivnarine Chanderpaul\ncentury. As I write this, Chanderpaul has now played more than 150 Test matches in his career. He has\nbeen one of the most consistent middle-order batsmen for the West Indies for close to two decades,\nwhich  is  remarkable.  We  followed  up  the  bowling  with  a  good  batting  effort  and  managed  a  small\nfirst-innings lead. I scored 92 and was wrongly given out to an Ian Bishop delivery by umpire Lloyd\nBarker. Replays showed that Bishop had overstepped by at least four inches and it was a key moment\nin the match. As things turned out, Lloyd Barker wasn’t able to officiate for much of the match after\nthat because – as I was told by the stand-in umpire who replaced him – he had had to go to hospital\nwith a serious headache and couldn’t focus properly.\nIn the second innings our bowlers did well to dismiss the West Indies for 140 on the third day of the\nmatch. This time Abey Kuruvilla picked up 5–68 and we needed 120 runs to win, on a pitch that was\nincreasingly  uneven,  with  plenty  of  wear  and  tear  for  the  West  Indian  fast  bowlers  to  exploit.  We\npicked  up  two  of  those  runs  without  loss  in  the  few  overs  we  had  to  see  out  at  the  end  of  Sunday’s\nplay. On that track we knew that scoring would not be easy the next day, but we also felt that one good\npartnership should be enough to take us to victory.\nA humiliating collapse\nMonday 31 March 1997 was a dark day in the history of Indian cricket and definitely the worst of my\ncaptaincy career. And yet it had promised so much. In fact, over dinner at a restaurant in St Lawrence\nGap  in  Barbados  the  night  before,  I  remember  having  a  joke  with  the  waiter,  who  was  predicting  a\nWest Indian win. He was confident that Ambrose would bounce India out the next morning. Now, in\nthe first innings of this match, Franklyn Rose had bowled me a bouncer and I had pulled him into the\nstands for six. So I reminded the waiter of the shot and jokingly said to him that if Ambrose tried to\nbowl me a bouncer, I would hit him all the way to Antigua. I was so confident of our chances that I\npointed to the fridge and said he should immediately chill a bottle of champagne and I would come\nand open it the next day and pour him a glass to celebrate winning the match.\nInstead, we collapsed for a miserable 81 all out, handing the West Indies a 38-run victory. Frankly,\nthere can be no excuses for such a poor batting effort, even though it was a difficult track. I certainly\ndon’t want to point fingers at anyone for the defeat, as that’s not my way. In any case, I was part of\nthat team and as captain it was my responsibility to steer us to victory. I did not get the feeling that we\nwere over-confident, yet none of the batsmen apart from Laxman even reached double figures in the\nsecond innings and it was one of the worst batting displays I have been part of.\nI myself got out for just four. In my anxiety to get a feel for the ball I got a tentative edge. I should\neither  have  left  the  ball  alone  or  tried  to  counter-attack.  The  defeat  left  me  totally  devastated  and  I\nshut myself in my room for two whole days trying to come to terms with the loss. I still feel the pangs\nof that defeat when I look back at the series.\nFrom bad to worse\nAfter eventually losing the five-Test series 0–1, we went on to lose the ODI series as well. The good\nstart to the tour had given way to a complete lack of application and that proved catastrophic in the\nend. The best example of this ineptitude was the third one-day game, at St Vincent, where we needed\n47  runs  to  win  off  the  last  ten  overs  with  six  wickets  in  hand.  Rahul  and  Sourav  had  set  up  the\nplatform and we should have strolled to victory. Again and again I instructed the batsmen not to go for\nbig shots and to play along the ground, saying there was no need for any risk-taking with the asking\nrate under five runs an over. However, all our middle- and lower-order batsmen kept playing the ball\nin the air. The loss of a few wickets resulted in panic, which in turn led to a number of suicidal run-\nouts. It was infuriating to see the team lose from a winning situation.\nAt  the  end  of  the  match  I  called  a  team  meeting  and  lost  my  cool  with  the  boys  in  the  dressing\nroom. I spoke from my heart and said the performance was unacceptable. I said that losing matches in\nwhich the opposition play better cricket is one thing – I had no problem with such defeats – but losing\na match that we had completely under control suggested there was something seriously wrong with the\nteam.\nI was extremely upset with the way we were playing and both Anil and Srinath came to my room in\nthe evening to try and calm me down. Anil said that I should not blame myself for the defeats and that\nwe would learn from the mistakes we had made in South Africa and the West Indies. However, things\nwere really starting to get on top of me. I hated losing and as captain of the team I felt responsible for\nthe string of miserable performances. More worryingly, I did not know how I could turn it around, as I\nwas already trying my absolute best.\nNot long after the series was over, I confided in Anjali that I feared there was nothing more that I\ncould do to stem the tide of defeats. Losing a string of very close matches had left me badly scarred. I\nhad given it everything and was not sure that I could give even 0.1 per cent more. The fact that we\nfailed to chase down 120 had nothing to do with lack of talent. It was because we batted horribly on\nthe day. It was hurting me badly and it took me a long time to come to terms with these failures. I\neven contemplated moving away from the sport completely, as it seemed nothing was going my way.\nAnjali,  as  usual,  managed  to  put  things  in  perspective  and  assured  me  that  things  would  surely  get\nbetter in the months to come. Looking back, it was just frustration getting the better of me.\nThe final few months\nThe string of defeats came to a temporary halt when we drew a two-Test series in Sri Lanka in August\n1997  and  then  beat  Pakistan  4–1  in  the  Sahara  Cup,  a  one-day  series  in  Toronto,  in  September.  The\ntournament  was  memorable  because  Sahara  had  not  only  lent  their  name  as  sponsors  but  senior\nofficials like Abhijit Sarkar were personally there to ensure that everything was in order and players\nfelt comfortable. This win was all the more satisfying because we played without Srinath, Prasad and\nAnil Kumble, and we had a young bowling unit. Sourav Ganguly was the star performer for us in the\nseries, winning four Man of the Match awards on the trot.\nThere was one rather strange incident during the second match of this series involving Inzamam-ul-\nHaq. While it appears funny in hindsight, it wasn’t at the time. During one of the drinks breaks when\nwe were batting, having bowled Pakistan out for 116, one of the Pakistan players who wasn’t playing\nin  the  match  took  out  a  bat  for  Inzamam  –  to  the  great  surprise  of  those  of  us  watching  from  the\ndressing room. We initially thought he was taking the bat out to get it autographed; only later did we\nrealize that Inzamam wanted it in order to charge at a few fans in the crowd who were taunting him\nbecause of his physique!\nWhen we came back from Toronto to Delhi, there were more than 5000 fans to receive us at one\nthirty in the morning at Delhi airport. The police were finding it difficult to control the crowd but I\ninsisted that the team should wave to the fans before we left the airport. It was a grand homecoming.\nHowever,  the  satisfaction  of  beating  Pakistan  was  short-lived,  because  within  weeks  we  had  lost  a\nthree-match ODI series in Pakistan.\nIn the second game, which we won, I remember telling our off-spinner Rajesh Chauhan how to play\nSaqlain Mushtaq’s doosra ball. I gave him a mini-lecture for five minutes or so and told him to give\nthe  strike  to  Robin  Singh,  who  was  batting  well  at  the  other  end.  To  my  surprise,  Rajesh  ended  up\nhitting a six in the last over and won us the game! However, we didn’t really celebrate, as there were\narmed guards outside our hotel rooms for security reasons, something that made us uncomfortable and\nput a dampener on things. The deciding match of the series belonged to Ijaz Ahmed, who smashed our\nbowlers to all parts of the park on his way to 139, winning the game for Pakistan comfortably.\nWhen we got back to Delhi this time having lost the series 1–2, the fans who had queued up just\nweeks earlier were nowhere to be seen. To cap it all, I also remember that those of us who were flying\non to Mumbai were asked to pay excess baggage. I told my team-mates that we should just pay up and\nnot argue.\nThe defeat in Pakistan added to the pressure that was building on me and an incident from the home\nTest series against Sri Lanka in November–December 1997 perhaps gives an indication of how I was\nfeeling  at  the  time. As  captain,  I  was  expected  to  deliver  a  winning  performance  in  the  three-Test\ncontest. I had not done well as a batsman in the first two Tests, both of which ended in draws. To add\nto my misery, the second Test at Nagpur was a washout. A section of the media was having a go at me\nbefore the third Test in Mumbai, which started on 3 December 1997, and a lot was written about my\npoor form. It was a crunch situation and I needed to deliver both as batsman and captain.\nOn the first day I went in to bat with an hour left and was unbeaten on eight at the end of play. I had\nnot batted at my best but at least I had survived. As the overnight not-out batsman, I needed to rest but\nas has often been the case with me, I couldn’t sleep. By 10.30 p.m. I had started to feel very agitated.\nTo get out of the stifling environment of the hotel, I called my friend Atul Ranade and asked him over.\nWhen he arrived I told him that I wanted to go for a drive and to visit the Shivaji Park temple.\nIt  felt  good  praying  at  well  past  midnight.  It  gave  me  a  sense  of  calm  again  and  helped  take  my\nmind off the game. Then we went to the Siddhi Vinayak temple and finally, on our way back to the\nhotel, decided to have a milkshake at Haji Ali. Strange as it may sound, Atul and I sat on the roadside\nat  1  a.m.  drinking  milkshake  and  relaxing.  We  talked  about  anything  but  cricket  and  I  was  feeling\nmuch better when I went back to the hotel. I even managed to get some sleep and the following day I\nmade 148.\nUnfortunately it didn’t bring the win I needed, even though at one point we were in a great position.\nAt a crucial moment in the innings we dropped a catch which would have put them under tremendous\npressure. To add to our frustration, it also started drizzling and the game was stopped. I felt it was a\ncombination of missed chances and bad luck that cost us the match.\nThe Sri Lanka series was followed by a four-nation tournament in Sharjah in December 1997. We\nplayed some very poor cricket against England, Pakistan and the West Indies, losing all our matches\nand failing to make the final. The match against Pakistan on 14 December highlights how things were\njust  not  going  my  way.  I  was  batting  at  number  four  in  this  competition,  at  the  selectors’  request.\nSourav and Navjot Sidhu had given us a good start against Pakistan, and when Sidhu got out at 143–2,\nI  sent  in  Robin  Singh,  the  all-rounder,  to  accelerate  the  innings.  It  was  a  strategy  I  had  given\nconsiderable thought to. Manzoor Akhtar, the leg-spinner, was at one end bowling around the wicket\nto the right-handed batsmen. The theory was that Robin, a left-hander, would be able to negotiate his\nleg-spin  better  and  also  hit  some  big  shots.  However,  Robin  got  out  without  scoring  after  just  three\nballs from Azhar Mahmood, the medium-pacer, and the experiment proved a disaster.\nIn  the  press  I  was  criticized  for  sending  in  Robin  ahead  of  me  and  the  move  was  blamed  for  our\ndefeat. A month later, however, in January 1998, Azhar, back as captain, repeated the very same move\nin  the  final  of  the  Silver  Jubilee  Independence  Cup  in  Dhaka  against  Pakistan.  Robin  was  sent  in  at\nthree to keep up the momentum after Sourav and I had got off to a flier and this time Robin played a\nterrific hand, scoring 82 and setting up the run chase. This was arguably a bigger gamble, because he\nwas  pitted  against  the  off-spinner  Saqlain  Mushtaq  and  it  is  no  secret  that  left-handers  find  it  more\ndifficult  against  off-spinners.  The  same  experiment  was  now  hailed  as  a  master  stroke.  Not  without\nreason is it said that success has many fathers while defeat is an orphan.\nThe  Sharjah  losses  were  followed  by  a  three-match  ODI  series  against  Sri  Lanka  at  home. After\nwe’d taken a 1–0 lead in the series, the second match was a washout and Sri Lanka played well to beat\nus in the third game in Goa. At the end of the series I was unceremoniously sacked as skipper. No one\nfrom the BCCI managed to call me or inform me of my removal as captain before someone from the\nmedia called to say I was no longer captain. I was actually with my friends in Sahitya Sahawas. I felt\nextremely humiliated to hear this, but the manner in which the whole thing was handled strengthened\nmy resolve to be a better cricketer in the years to come. I told myself that the BCCI mandarins might\nbe able to take the captaincy away from me, but no one could do the same as far as my own cricket\nwas  concerned.  The  sense  of  ignominy  and  the  pain  were  still  there,  however.  During  my  tenure  as\ncaptain some of the players used to call me ‘skip’, so when one of the players shouted out ‘skipper’ in\nour next engagement in Dhaka, I automatically turned around to answer the call. That’s when it really\nhit me that I was no longer the captain of the Indian cricket team. Now I simply had to focus on my\nbatting and win some matches for the team. So that’s what I did. In fact, not long after this, I was so\nfocused on doing well that I ended up shouting at someone who has since become a good friend. This\nincident, which has caused us both much embarrassment, took place in the second of the three finals\nof the Silver Jubilee Independence Cup in Dhaka in 1998. There was a lot of movement in front of and\naround the sightscreen and, despite my repeated complaints, things did not improve. I was distracted\nand lost my wicket soon after. On my way back to the pavilion I was livid and, when someone came\nacross to apologize, I just screamed at him, saying Bangladesh did not deserve to host international\ncricket if the basic fundamentals were not in place. Only later did I realize that the man I had yelled at\nwas Ashraful Haq, then president of the Bangladesh Cricket Board and currently chief executive of the\nAsian Cricket Council. Ever since, whenever we meet, we start by saying sorry to each other for what\nhappened!\nAustralia in India 1996 – The Border-Gavaskar Trophy\nOne-off Test.

            "title": "A FOUR-MONTH HONEYMOON\n",
            "data": "The three-Test series in March 1998 was the first fully fledged home series against Australia of my\ncareer. It generated a lot of hype and much of it was being built up as a contest between myself and\nShane Warne. It’s inevitable that there are times when battles between two individuals hog most of the\nlimelight. For example, Brian Lara versus Glenn McGrath, Ricky Ponting versus Courtney Walsh, or\neven Tendulkar versus Lara, as had been the case in 1994. I always said that this series was a contest\nbetween  two  teams  and  not  two  individuals,  though  in  my  heart  of  hearts  I  knew  it  was  a  very\nimportant  match-up  against  Warne.  Shane  was  bowling  beautifully  and  had  just  had  a  great  series\nagainst South Africa in Australia, taking twenty wickets in three Tests.\nKnowing  that  I  would  soon  be  facing  him,  I  studied  Warne’s  bowling  in  that  series  carefully.  It\nappeared  to  me  that  his  biggest  strength  was  the  drift  he  managed  to  get,  which  meant  that  the\nbatsman  was  somewhat  blinded  by  the  delivery  if  he  was  batting  with  a  traditional  side-on  stance.\nBecause  of  the  extra  drift,  the  ball  would  tend  to  go  away  from  the  vision  of  the  batsman  and  it\nbecame  that  much  more  difficult  to  negotiate  the  extra  spin. As  a  result,  I  decided  to  open  up  my\nstance a little to Warne and to stand slightly outside the leg stump. I also planned to play him more\nfrom the crease and as late as possible. I hardly stepped out to him all series and, more often than not,\nkept hitting him towards midwicket with a horizontal bat whenever he tried to extract extra spin from\nleg stump or slightly outside. By playing from the crease and by using the horizontal bat, I reckoned I\nhad opened up the option of punishing him if he bowled short and could also play the cut shot on the\noff side. While there was always the risk of a top edge, I was prepared to accept it to surprise Warne.\nAfter all, he was Australia’s most potent weapon and I had to have a strategy against him.\nHaving worked on the theory, I now needed to practise against the kind of deliveries Warne would\nuse when under pressure. I started training in late January, with still a month to go before the series,\nand  asked  for  the  best  spinners  available  in  Mumbai  to  bowl  at  me  from  round  the  wicket  into  the\nrough  outside  leg  stump.  I  was  certain  that’s  what  Warne  would  do  if  I  succeeded  in  attacking  him\nwhen he bowled from over the wicket. All that practice in Mumbai against Sairaj Bahutule and Nilesh\nKulkarni,  both  of  whom  played  for  India  against  Australia  in  2001,  and  subsequently  in  Chennai\nagainst Laxman Sivaramakrishnan, now a respected television commentator who played for India in\nthe mid-1980s, proved immensely useful, and by the time the Australians arrived in India in February\n1998 I felt ready to face Warne.\nAn early skirmish\nThe first game the Australians played was against Mumbai on 24 February. I was captaining Mumbai\nand knew it was crucial to establish a psychological advantage over the visitors at the start of the tour.\nThe  most  important  thing  was  to  attack  Warne.  I  had  instructed  all  our  batsmen  to  take  Warne  on\nwhenever he came on to bowl. I did not care if we lost wickets, but there was no way we would allow\nWarne to settle into his groove and dictate terms.\nWhen it was our turn to bat, Amit Pagnis, opening the batting for Mumbai, did exactly what we had\nplanned. Though we lost an early wicket in Sulakshan Kulkarni, Pagnis and I attacked Warne from the\nstart. While Pagnis hit Warne for four boundaries in two overs, I hit him for a six in his very first over\nand continued to attack him right through the innings. His sixteen overs cost him 111 runs and that\nwas far more important than my own double hundred off 192 balls – though I was particularly pleased\nwith my effort because I had made a conscious attempt to dominate the bowling and it was my first\ndouble  in  first-class  cricket.  Having  conceded  a  lead  of  more  than  100  in  the  first  innings,  the\nAustralians collapsed to 135 all out in their second innings, with Nilesh Kulkarni, who had first played\nfor India in 1996, running through half the side. We finished the match without losing a wicket in our\nsecond innings, handing the Australians a ten-wicket defeat.\nA crushing loss in the first tour game was the worst possible start for the world’s best team and was\nmore than we could have hoped for. We now needed to carry the momentum forward into the first Test\nmatch  in  Chennai.  Of  course,  I  was  well  aware  that  the  Australians  had  not  played  all  their  cards\nagainst  Mumbai.  Even  when  we  were  attacking  Shane  Warne,  not  once  did  he  bowl  from  round  the\nwicket into the rough outside leg stump. I was certain he would do so at the first available opportunity\nin Chennai, and I even said as much in the post-match press conference in Mumbai. The series was\nnicely set up.\nFirst Test, Chennai, 6–10 March 1998\nHaving  played  a  lot  of  cricket  in  Chennai,  I  knew  that  the  physical  preparation  in  the  lead-up  to  a\nChennai  Test  has  to  be  different  from  normal.  You  have  to  prepare  your  body  for  the  heat  and\nhumidity well in advance and I always did so at least thirty-six hours before the match by drinking a\nlot  more  water  than  normal.  The  extra  water  intake  was  particularly  important,  because  you  lose  so\nmuch fluid during matches at the Chidambaram Stadium.\nNowadays,  unlike  in  the  late  1980s  and  1990s,  when  there  wasn’t  much  research  about  players’\ndiets  and  training  schedules,  cricket  is  much  more  sophisticated  about  such  matters.  There  are\nspecialized  dieticians  who  draw  up  charts  of  what  players  can  or  can’t  eat. After  long  and  arduous\nbatting  stints,  players  take  ice  baths  and  drink  specially  prepared  shakes  to  rehydrate  the  body  and\nreplace lost energy. For example, I remember Paddy Upton, our high-performance trainer, asking me\nto  drink  two  glasses  of  a  shake  made  of  crushed  dry  fruits  after  a  particularly  draining  innings  at\nGwalior in 2010.\nAt Chennai, we won the toss and opted to bat first. It was an important toss to win, as the ball was\nexpected  to  turn  in  the  fourth  innings  and  we  were  playing  three  spinners  in Anil  Kumble,  Rajesh\nChauhan and Venkatapathy Raju. Despite a good start, with the top three of Mongia, Sidhu and Dravid\nall  scoring  fifties,  we  lost  our  way  in  the  middle  of  the  first  innings  and  failed  to  push  home  the\nadvantage, getting bowled out for a modest 257. Batting at number four, I managed just four runs and\nfell to Warne. I hit him for a boundary and then tried to repeat the shot, only to get an outside edge to\nMark  Taylor  at  slip.  I  was  extremely  disappointed  with  myself  for  not  playing  myself  in  and  was\ndetermined to make amends in the second innings.\nOur bowlers, in particular Kumble and Raju, did well to get the first eight Australian wickets for\n201. It seemed we had a good chance of taking a first-innings lead, but we were frustrated when the\nAustralian wicketkeeper Ian Healy and off-spinner Gavin Robertson, the debutant, put together a very\ngood  partnership.  They  added  96  runs  between  them,  and  Australia  eventually  gained  a  71-run\nadvantage. It seemed a crucial lead and at a dinner organized by former BCCI president AC Muthiah,\nSrinivas Venkataraghavan, a former India captain and leading off-spinner of the 1970s, said to me that\nit  would  be  very  difficult  for  us  to  get  back  into  the  match.  He  said  that  he  thought  there  wasn’t\nenough time left in the game to make up the deficit, set a target and finally bowl Australia out to win\nthe match. I replied confidently that there was still plenty of time and that I was sure we would be able\nto turn things round.\nBefore  the  start  of  our  second  innings  I  remember  saying  in  the  dressing  room  that  it  was  the\nresponsibility  of  the  batsmen  to  put  their  hands  up  and  try  to  score  75  runs  each  for  the  team. You\ndon’t always need to set the bar really high and demand a hundred. I thought that scoring 75 in the\nsecond innings at Chennai would be good enough to set up the match.\nWhen  Sidhu  was  out  for  an  important  64,  I  walked  out  to  bat  at  115–2,  in  effect  44–2  after\ndeducting  the  deficit  of  71  runs,  and  as  on  many  occasions  in  my  career  I  had  Rahul  Dravid  for\ncompany  in  the  middle.  I  started  out  watchfully  and  was  soon  into  my  groove. As  expected,  Shane\nWarne  started  to  bowl  round  the  wicket  and  I  instantly  took  the  attack  to  him  and  hit  him  over\nmidwicket. From an individual perspective it was a defining moment in the game. We couldn’t afford\nto lose another wicket, but we also couldn’t go too much on the defensive.\nRahul  and  I  added  more  than  a  hundred  runs,  to  set  up  a  strong  platform.  By  the  time  Rahul  was\ndismissed for another well-played half-century, I felt in control. I went on the attack and scored at a\nfair clip, hitting fours and sixes with regularity. Azhar gave me good support and we also added over a\nhundred runs, at almost five runs an over, a potentially match-winning partnership.\nWhen we declared, I was not out on 155, the first-innings lead had been nullified and we were in\nwith a great chance of winning the match, having set the Australians a target of 348 on a turning track.\nIt  was  certainly  one  of  my  better  hundreds  and  what  made  the  sensation  sweeter  was  that  we\nproceeded  to  bowl  the  Australians  out  for  168,  with  Kumble  taking  four  wickets,  and  we  won  the\nmatch by 179 runs. It was a tremendous start and, to add to my delight, I was Man of the Match. I had\nmade up for getting out to Warne cheaply in the first innings of the match.\nImportantly, we had performed as a unit and most of the senior members had played their parts to\nperfection. Anil  had  taken  eight  wickets  in  the  game  while  Navjot  Sidhu,  opening  the  batting,  had\ndone a good job in both innings. He had attacked Warne from the start of our second innings and had\nset the game up for the other batsmen. Rahul too batted well in each innings and pocketed a couple of\nimportant  catches  at  slip.  We  had  shown  good  fighting  spirit  and  that,  more  than  anything,  augured\nwell for the team for the second Test match at Eden Gardens in Kolkata later that month.\nSecond Test, Kolkata, 18–21 March 1998\nIf Chennai was a rollercoaster, we were in control in Kolkata from the start. Australia won the toss at\nEden  Gardens  but  failed  to  press  home  an  early  advantage,  losing  four  top-order  wickets  within  the\nfirst hour of play. Srinath bowled a fine opening spell to take three wickets and Sourav too chipped in\nwith the wicket of Mark Taylor. Despite a brief period of Australian resurgence under Steve Waugh\nand Ricky Ponting, we kept our nerve and bowled them out for 233 in the first innings.\nOur  batsmen  followed  up  with  some  big  runs  and  for  a  rare  occasion  in  Test  cricket  all  first  five\nbatsmen  passed  75,  with Azhar  going  on  to  score  a  hundred  at  his  favourite  venue.  I  scored  79  and\nonce again took the attack to Shane Warne, who went wicketless in his forty-two overs, conceding 147\nruns. The plan against Warne was working and without his wickets the Australians were in trouble. I\nremember one particular shot against Warne on day two. In my determination to attack him, I hadn’t\nnoticed that it was the last over before tea and I hit him for a big six over long on, which I normally\nwouldn’t have risked so close to a break. It just goes to show how hard you had to concentrate to cope\nwith Warne.\nWe knew, of course, that the Australians were all excellent players, despite being at the receiving\nend for the time being, and we knew that it was important to keep them under pressure throughout the\nmatch. A champion team needs only a small window of opportunity to stage a fightback, something I\nhad learnt over the years. If the Australians were on the back foot, you couldn’t allow them the whiff\nof an opportunity to stage a recovery. We needed to be ruthless and we were. Having scored 633 in our\nfirst  innings,  we  let  Kumble  and  Srinath  do  the  rest  on  a  track  that  was  offering  variable  bounce.\nAustralia  collapsed  for  181  in  their  second  innings,  giving  us  one  of  our  biggest  Test  wins.  More\nimportantly, we were 2–0 up in the three-Test series against the best team in the world and were justly\nproud of the achievement.\nThird Test, Bangalore, 25–28 March 1998\nIn the final match of the series our team included a teenaged debutant in off-spinner Harbhajan Singh.\nI scored a big hundred in the first innings and once again we managed to put the Australian bowlers\nunder pressure. Though Warne picked up three wickets, he also went for a lot of runs. To his credit, he\nwas always in the game, despite being attacked. In fact, as I played out the last over of the first day\nagainst him, I had to keep telling myself to concentrate till the very last ball was bowled. A true great,\nWarne would not let you relax for a single delivery.\nMark Waugh batted brilliantly in the Australian first innings, scoring an unbeaten 153, and Michael\nKasprowicz, the fast bowler, picked up a five-wicket haul in our second innings to set up the match. I\nwas caught and bowled by Kasprowicz for 31, playing a ball early, and we collapsed for a paltry 169.\nThere  was  no  doubt  about  it: Australia  had  played  better  than  us  in  Bangalore  and  had  shown  what\nthey were made of. For our part, we were disappointed at not closing out the series on a winning note.\nIt  was  one  of  the  most  intense  series  I  played  in  my  career,  and  one  of  the  most  personally\nsuccessful. I had scored close to 450 runs at an average of 111. Weeks of rigorous practice had paid\noff and it was a deeply satisfying feeling.\nPepsi triangular series, April 1998\nThe Test series was followed by a one-day tri-series, with Zimbabwe as the third team. Our first match\nwas against Australia at Kochi on 1 April, and it remains a match I have extremely fond memories of.\nI  was  opening  the  batting  again  in  one-day  cricket  by  this  stage  but  unfortunately  got  out  early.\nLuckily it did not matter, with Ajay Jadeja batting well in the middle order for a hundred and taking us\npast 300.\nAustralia got off to a flier. Adam Gilchrist, the best wicketkeeper-batsman of our generation, went\nafter the bowling and they cruised to 100 in just twelve overs. It was apparent that if they played out\nthe full fifty overs they’d win the game. Midway through the innings, I was brought on to bowl and I\nstarted bowling off-spin to the left-handers and leg-spin to the right-handers.\nIt’s  one  of  those  strange  things,  but  for  some  reason  sometimes  a  batsman  just  does  not  like  the\nsight of a particular bowler. In my case, I was never comfortable facing Hansie Cronje, who got me\nout on a number of occasions with his medium pace. Even when I was in control against the likes of\nAllan  Donald,  Hansie  would  somehow  get  the  better  of  me  and  I’d  get  out  to  him  in  the  most\nunexpected ways. So you don’t always need to be a front-line bowler to trouble a particular batsman –\nand that’s what happened between me and Steve Waugh. Throughout my career I had a feeling Steve\nwasn’t  comfortable  against  my  leg-spin.  At  Kochi,  I  bowled  a  perfect  leg-spinner  to  him  and  he\nlobbed the ball straight back to me.\nI was elated at the dismissal and it was a big moment in the game. It was the opening we needed to\nput the pressure back on the Australians. The other big wicket that gave me a lot of satisfaction was\nthat of Michael Bevan, a very effective batsman in limited-overs cricket, who was constantly trying to\ncome down the wicket to negate the turn. I had warned Nayan Mongia, our wicketkeeper, that I’d bowl\na  quick  one  down  the  leg  side  if  I  saw  Bevan  try  that  against  me.  The  ploy  worked  and  Bevan  was\nstumped off a wide ball down the leg side.\nThis  was  one  of  those  rare  matches  when  every  ball  was  coming  out  of  the  hand  perfectly,  and  I\neven had a fielder at slip past the thirty-over mark. The odd thing is that over the course of my career I\nfound that whenever I practised hard at bowling leg-spin, I could never land the ball properly. And yet\nsometimes when I hadn’t practised for months it just landed on the spot at crucial times in a match. In\nthe  end  I  decided  to  bowl  leg-spin  in  the  nets  as  and  when  I  felt  like  it,  without  thinking  too  much\nabout  the  technical  aspects.  In  any  case,  Anil  Kumble  once  explained  to  me  that  to  bowl  leg-spin\nconsistently, I needed to hold my shoulder while bowling. What he meant was that I needed to have\nmy fingers, arm and shoulder position aligned for longer. It was something I could never get the hang\nof, so I just left it to my natural ability, and I rarely bowled more than three overs at a stretch in a\nmatch unless I was bowling really well. This gave me licence to experiment and I could give the ball a\nrip if I wished to. At Kochi it all worked beautifully. I finished with 5–32 and Australia were bowled\nout for 268 in the forty-sixth over. We had won the match by 41 runs.\nWe continued the good form against the Australians in the next ODI at the Green Park stadium in\nKanpur on 7 April. It was a low-scoring encounter, with the Australians setting us 222 to chase. The\npitch was keeping low and I had figured out that the best option was to be aggressive at the start. I got\nanother hundred in this match and remember one particular shot against Tom Moody. Even before he\nhad released the ball, I stepped out and he followed me. The ball was down the leg side and, having\nstepped out of my crease, I wasn’t in the best position to meet the delivery. I connected on the full but\nplayed it slightly off-balance. To my surprise, the ball landed in the stands, way beyond the boundary.\nLater in the innings I came down the wicket to Warne and this time the ball hit the bottom of my bat.\nWarne immediately screamed ‘Catch it!’ – only to see the ball soar over the long-on fielder and land\n10 yards behind him for another six. I hit seven in all and we won the game comfortably, to book a\nspot in the final, which we unfortunately lost to Australia. It was disappointing after winning all the\ngroup matches and it resulted in an imperfect end to the tour.\nCoca-Cola Cup, April 1998\nSoon after the series was over we went to Sharjah for yet another tri-series, with Australia and New\nZealand. It is a tournament I remember well because I played some of my best cricket and because of\nan  incident  that  took  place  on  the  flight  out  to  Sharjah.  The  Indian  team  included  two  relative\nnewcomers,  Harbhajan  Singh  and  Harvinder  Singh,  the  medium-fast  bowler.  The  flight  attendant\nasked both of them if they wanted soup. Not very good with English at the time, Harvinder may not\nhave understood the question. I overheard Harvinder tell Bhajji that it was prudent just to take what\nwas being served. Then Harvinder, trying to figure out what to add to his soup, ended up adding sugar-\nfree sweetener instead of salt. Bhaji, who always enjoyed a laugh, was aware of what Harvinder had\ndone and kept asking him if he was enjoying his food! Harvinder was too embarrassed to admit his\nmistake and so he pretended to like it.\nSharjah,  in April,  was  hot,  very  hot.  The  heat  was  oppressive  and  it  was  a  real  test  of  stamina.  I\ncould  feel  the  heat  through  my  shoes  and  it  often  caused  a  burning  sensation,  which  was  extremely\ndiscomforting. It was physically draining to bat for long hours and, with little recovery time between\ngames, it was a stern test of a player’s skill, both physical and mental.\nThe two matches everyone remembers were both against Australia, on 22 and 24 April 1998. The\nfirst one was our last round-robin game, which we needed to win, or score a certain number of runs in,\nto qualify for the final. Australia had already made it to the final by winning all three of their pool\ngames.\nIn  the  first  of  the  two  games, Australia  batted  first  and  scored  a  very  healthy  284,  with  81  from\nMark  Waugh  and  a  century  from  Bevan.  We  needed  a  good  start  to  get  our  chase  on  track.\nUnfortunately,  however,  we  had  lost  four  wickets  for  just  138  runs  in  twenty-nine  overs  when  the\nmatch was interrupted. I had never seen a sandstorm in my life. Waves of sand were blowing from one\nend of the ground to the other and the wind was so strong that I feared my five-foot-five-inch frame\nwould get blown away. The wind was also causing a strange sound and we could only see a few metres\nahead  of  us.  Players  and  umpires  were  understandably  worried  about  getting  sand  in  their  eyes  and\ninstinctively  dropped  to  the  ground.  I  quickly  went  and  lay  down  behind  Adam  Gilchrist,  who  I\nreckoned was strong enough to withstand the force of the wind. My plan was simple – if the wind ever\ngot too strong, I would hold on to Gilchrist for support. While it appears funny in hindsight to have\nused an Australian wicketkeeper as a shield, the whole experience was rather strange to start with.\nBecause  the  match  was  interrupted  for  more  than  forty-five  minutes,  it  was  reduced  to  forty-six\novers  a  side  but  the  target  was  cut  by  only  eight  runs.  To  win  the  match,  we  now  needed  138  off\nseventeen overs, which may appear eminently gettable in this age of Twenty20 cricket but was a really\nsteep target in 1998. A deduction of eight runs for the loss of four overs didn’t make sense to us, and\nwe knew we were up against it. Effectively the target to win had become stiffer. On the other hand, to\nqualify, we only needed 100 runs.\nAnshuman  Gaekwad,  a  former  India  opening  batsman  and  then  our  coach,  was  in  charge  of  the\ncalculations and I asked him the exact target before I went out to resume the innings. Several of my\nteam-mates  thought  we  should  just  concentrate  on  getting  the  100  runs  we  needed  for  qualification\nand not risk our place in the final by going for the win. However, I was determined to win the match\nand go to the finals, because I was timing the ball well and felt good about my batting. And beating\nAustralia would give us an edge over them in the final.\nIt was important not to let the Australian bowlers settle. I hit Tom Moody for a six as soon as the\ngame resumed, making my intentions clear. I followed it up with another six off Warne and attacked\nthe Australians  in  every  over  I  faced.  They  were  doing  their  best  to  keep  me  off  strike,  while  my\npartner VVS Laxman was doing his best to make sure I faced the bulk of the bowling. Looking back, I\nfeel I owe him an apology as at one point I lost my temper with him when he refused a second run,\nthinking I was in danger of getting run out. I just wanted to play every ball I could.\nWhen we passed 200 I started to feel that the Australian score was within reach. I was determined to\nbat on and finish the game. I have to say that if I had not got out to a dubious decision by the umpire\nwith  three  overs  still  left  in  the  game,  I  think  we  would  probably  have  chased  down  the Australian\nscore. I was given out to Damien Fleming, caught by Gilchrist for 143, when the ball seemed to me to\nbe above shoulder height and should have been declared a no-ball. But such things happen in cricket\nand in the end we lost the game but qualified for the final and still had a chance for revenge.\nThinking  of  this  match  reminds  me  of  a  story  about  Anshuman  Gaekwad.  I  have  very  fond\nmemories of Anshu bhai as our coach and he undoubtedly had a very positive influence and helped me\nin a number of ways, but I can also never forget his amazing capacity to eat the hottest of hot food. On\none occasion in New Zealand in 1999 he asked the hotel chef to make a paste of green chillies for him.\nThe chef took on the challenge and returned later with a fresh bowl of chilli paste, warning him that he\nshould be careful only to have a little because it was extremely hot. To the chef’s amazement, Anshu\nbhai  gratefully  took  the  bowl  from  him  and  polished  off  the  lot  without  breaking  sweat  –  and  even\nasked for some more! Frankly, no one else could have eaten even half a spoonful.\nA final to remember\nWhen we returned to the hotel after the last pool game, I was very tired and yet I just couldn’t get to\nsleep. I eventually dropped off well after 2 a.m. With just a day before the final, this didn’t bode well.\nIn the extreme heat I had lost a lot of fluid and I needed time to get myself rehydrated and allow my\nbody and mind to recover.\nWhen  I  got  up  in  the  morning  my  body  was  stiff.  My  back  was  tight  and  I  was  even  finding  it\ndifficult  to  walk  to  the  bathroom.  The  stiffness  was  partly  a  result  of  the  dehydration  and  the  first\nthing I did was drink a lot of water. There have been a few occasions in my career when I have had\ndifficulties standing up straight in the mornings. Sometimes I have really had to push myself to get off\nthe bed and in extreme situations the physio and the masseur have had to give me a helping hand. Of\ncourse, I didn’t mind the stiffness so much if I had scored a hundred or played a match-winning knock\nthe day before. In that case, it was a happy feeling and a reminder of the effort I had put in! However,\nif the stiffness was caused by fielding for two long days, I would resent it immensely. So at Sharjah I\nhad no reason to complain about the pain – it was a very small price to pay.\nAt  lunchtime,  I  met  Mark  Mascarenhas  for  a  meal  at  his  hotel.  Ravi  Shastri,  Shane  Warne  and\nRichie Benaud, former Australian captain and one of the greatest cricketers to have played the game,\nwere also present and I had a brief non-cricketing chat with them all before returning to the hotel. I\nwasn’t particularly concerned about the physical aspect of the recovery, as I was confident of digging\ninto  my  reserves.  I  was  more  concerned  with  the  mental  recovery  after  such  a  high-intensity\nencounter.\nIn  the  evening,  I  had  an  interesting  conversation  with  Mark.  It  was  the  Coca-Cola  Cup  and  I  was\ninformed  that,  as  sponsors,  Coca-Cola  wanted  to  announce  a  reward  for  me  for  the  innings  I  had\nplayed  the  night  before.  They  wanted  to  give  me  £25,000,  which  was  a  substantial  sum  of  money.\nWhen Mark asked me what I’d do with it, I said that I would share it with my team-mates. It was our\npractice to share rewards among all players and I’d do no different. After that the issue wasn’t raised\nagain and I had put it out of my mind by the time I went to bed.\nIn  the  final,  Australia  batted  first  and  put  272  runs  on  the  board.  It  was  a  very  good  score,\nconsidering it was the final. We couldn’t afford to lose an early wicket and I knew I had to stay in to\nset up the game. People were expecting me to blast the Australian attack from ball one, but that was an\nimpossible proposition. Perhaps in people’s minds I could just pick up from where I had left off two\nnights  before.  The  reality,  of  course,  was  different.  It  was  a  new  match  and  I  was  starting  a  new\ninnings. I had to play myself in all over again and it wasn’t going to be easy.\nTo make matters more difficult, the Australians bowled a good line and I had to work very hard not\nto get out. In the first over I faced against Damien Fleming, I played five dot-balls and was trying to\nleave the sixth ball, which hit my inside edge and went for a streaky boundary, missing the stumps by\ntwo  inches.  It  was  a  lucky  escape  and  I  told  myself  that  I  was  obviously  still  fatigued  and  wasn’t\nmoving  my  feet  properly.  I  would  have  to  spend  time  in  the  middle  for  my  body  to  get  used  to  the\nconditions and for my timing to come back.\nWe managed to score just 12 in the first five overs and the Australians continued to apply pressure\nby  bowling  a  very  tight  line  around  the  off  stump.  There  were  no  loose  balls  on  offer  and  I  wasn’t\nhappy. The pressure was mounting and it was time to try something different. I was forced to take a\nrisk to push the run rate up and so I came down the wicket to Michael Kasprowicz in the sixth over of\nour  innings.  I  managed  to  connect  well  and  the  ball  soared  over  the  boundary.  The  crowd  was  in\nraptures and the bowler was taken by surprise. I now anticipated that he’d bowl me a bouncer the very\nnext ball. It is a fast bowler’s natural response and I was more than prepared for it. I stayed back in the\ncrease and easily hit the short ball for another six. It definitely rattled Kasprowicz and the Australians.\nThe risks I had taken had paid off and the touch had come back. There was no need for any further\nrisk-taking and the run chase was back on track.\nWith  Nayan  Mongia,  who  had  been  promoted  up  the  order,  and Azhar  giving  me  good  support,  I\nwas able to pace my innings without allowing the Australian bowlers to dominate and gradually the\nmatch was turning our way. Shane Warne tried coming round the wicket and yet again I countered him\nby hitting him over midwicket and square leg. With Warne ineffective – he conceded more than six\nruns  an  over  in  his  spell  –  the  Australians  were  forced  to  turn  to  Tom  Moody.  We  attacked  him\nthroughout his spell and also put pressure on Australia’s irregular bowlers, Mark and Steve Waugh.\nBy the time I finally got out for 134, the result was a mere formality. We needed just 24 from six\novers. As I was walking back to the pavilion I could see Mark Mascarenhas waiting for me next to the\nsightscreen. I was soaked in sweat and, seeing Mark was about to give me a hug, I remember warning\nhim that he would spoil his smart clothes. Mark wasn’t bothered and he lifted me up into the air with a\nsmile.\nThe post-match presentation turned out to be really special. Steve Waugh said that they had lost to\nme, which was quite something coming from the Australian captain on a day which also happened to\nbe my twenty-fifth birthday. There could have been no better birthday present.\nDuring the presentation an announcement was made by Coca-Cola that they had decided to give me\na Mercedes SL600. I have always been interested in cars and remembered my first introduction to a\nvariety of fancy cars such as BMWs on my first trip to England with the Star Cricket Club in 1988.\nGood to be back\nOn  our  return  to  Mumbai  we  were  greeted  by  a  sea  of  humanity  and  it  was  touching  to  see  fans\nshowering such warmth on the players. In the ultimate analysis, we play for our fans and to be able to\nmake them happy has always been extremely important.\nSometimes  things  can  get  a  little  out  of  hand,  however.  After  coming  back  from  Sharjah  I  was\ninvited to a double-wicket tournament at the Shivaji Park Gymkhana in Mumbai. Pravin Amre called\nme and said the organizers were keen for me to go along to encourage the players. Shivaji Park has\nalways been special to me and I decided to take Anjali with me. When we arrived we found that a huge\ncrowd had assembled to see me. My visit had caused a law-and-order situation and in the end it was\ndifficult to get away from the chaos. We somehow managed to leave Shivaji Park Gymkhana for home\nand I felt humbled at the affection I had received. Fans asking for autographs always made me feel\nspecial and I make it a point to oblige them whenever I can. The people who wait for hours are the\nones who make the game what it is in India and we are lucky that we have such a passionate fanbase\nfor the sport in the country.\nLooking  back  at  the  four  months  between  January  and  April  1998,  I  feel  a  sense  of  deep\nsatisfaction. I had led the charge against the Australians and had enjoyed the personal contest against\nShane  Warne.  But  it  didn’t  stop  there.  I  went  on  to  bat  at  close  to  my  best  throughout  1998  and  in\nNovember played my part in winning us the Champions Trophy tri-series at Sharjah against Sri Lanka\nand Zimbabwe.\nWhat I remember about that competition is that the Zimbabwe fast bowler Henry Olonga had taken\nme by surprise in the last match of the group stage with a short ball and the manner of my dismissal\nhad kept me restless right up to the final. So much so that I decided I had to settle the scores. It was\nlike in boxing – either you go down or I go down. In the final I managed to score 124 off ninety-two\nballs,  but  I  must  confess  that  some  of  my  shots  were  not  what  you  might  call  orthodox  cricketing\nshots, as all I was doing was smashing the ball. That’s what happens when you are batting well – even\nslogs go for boundaries – whereas during a lean patch, you get out to bad balls.\nInvitations I couldn’t turn down\nA  few  months  before  that  Champions  Trophy,  in  July  and August  1998,  two  things  happened  that  I\nwill  never  forget.  The  first  was  that  I  was  invited  to  play  in  the  Princess  Diana  Memorial  Match  at\nLord’s  on  18  July.  The  opposition  bowling  line-up  included  Glenn  McGrath,  Javagal  Srinath, Allan\nDonald and Anil Kumble, and I managed to score 125 against them while opening the batting. Though\nI didn’t manage to make a hundred at Lord’s in Test cricket, this was a ton I have fond memories of,\nespecially because it came against a top-quality bowling attack.\nThe second memorable thing happened in August when Shane Warne and I had the great honour of\nbeing  invited  to  visit  Sir  Don  Bradman  at  his  house  in  Adelaide  on  the  occasion  of  his  ninetieth\nbirthday.  We  were  both  very  nervous  about  meeting  the  great  man  and  I  remember  debating  with\nShane in the taxi on the way about who should talk to him first. I said that it should be Shane, because\nhe’s a fellow Australian; he said that it should be me, because I’m a fellow batsman. In the end, Sir\nDon,  who  fondly  referred  to  me  as  ‘Bonzer’,  took  control  of  proceedings  as  soon  as  we  arrived  and\nquickly made us feel at ease.\nOne  of  the  things  I  remember  asking  him  was  how  he  thought  he  would  have  coped  in  the\ncontemporary game. He said that he didn’t think he would have scored quite so many runs because of\nthe  more  defensive  field  settings  that  are  used  nowadays;  when  he  was  playing,  the  fields  weren’t\nchanged  much,  even  if  a  batsman  was  scoring  a  lot  of  runs,  and  fielding  positions  like  deep  point\nweren’t in vogue back in the 1930s. He also said that the standard of fielding was much better in the\ncontemporary game.\nFinally, we asked what he thought his Test average would be if he played today. ‘Around 70,’ he\nsaid. We were slightly surprised and asked if he was sure it would be so much lower than his famous\ncareer average of 99.94. He said, ‘Well, 70 isn’t bad for a ninety-year-old!’\nAll in all, 1998 was a special year in my career.\nAustralia in India 1998 – The Border–Gavaskar Trophy\n1st Test.

            "title": "TUMULTUOUS TIMES\n",
            "data": "While I was starting to play some of the best cricket of my career, at home my life had undergone a\nfundamental transformation. That is because on 12 October 1997 I had received my greatest ever gift,\nwith Anjali giving birth to our first child. I had shared the news that I was expecting a child with my\nteam-mates when we were touring Zimbabwe in February 1997 and organized an impromptu party in\ncelebration. I was thrilled at the thought of becoming a father.\nThe  night  before  the  moment  finally  arrived  I  was  with  my  friend  Sunil  Harshe  on  the  terrace  of\nAnjali’s family’s house in Breach Candy. The house was just two minutes away from the hospital and\nI  had  been  told  by Anjali’s  paediatrician  friend,  Dr Ajit  Gajendragadkar,  that  he  would  call  me  the\nmoment they brought her out of the delivery room. My prolonged presence in the hospital would have\ncaused difficulties for the authorities and it was best that I waited for the call. Restless and anxious, I\nwas  lying  on  the  terrace,  staring  up  at  the  sky,  and  I  remember  saying  to  Sunil  that  within  hours  I\nwould be a father and turn a new page in my life. All I was praying for was that Anjali and the child\nwould both be safe and healthy.\nWhen Dr Gajendragadkar finally called me with the good news the following day, I arrived at the\nhospital within minutes with a video camera in my hand. Seconds after reaching the maternity ward, I\nsaw the doctor carrying my child in his arms and that’s when I was told that God had blessed us with a\nbaby girl. I recorded the whole thing and cherish the recording of the doctor bringing my daughter out\nto me. It’s impossible to describe the overwhelming sensation of seeing my child for the first time. I\nwent up to Anjali and said to her that we would call our daughter Sara. In fact, it was a name that Ajit\nhad suggested and both Anjali and I loved it. When the doctor asked me to hold Sara, I was much too\nnervous to do so at first, though I was longing to take her in my arms. I had never held a newborn in\nmy life.\nOn the day of Sara’s birth, I asked permission from the hospital authorities to stay with Anjali in\nher room. I simply did not want to leave my wife and daughter alone. While I knew that they were in\ngood  hands,  I  wanted  to  be  with  them  the  whole  time.  They  were  only  too  kind  and  suggested  that,\nwhile there wasn’t an extra bed for me, I could stay in the same room as Anjali and they were happy to\nprovide a mattress, which was placed on the floor. That was fine with me and I will always appreciate\ntheir help.\nSara, according to everyone who saw her, was a carbon copy of me and I loved the act of putting her\nto sleep in my arms. I would just rock her for a couple of minutes and she would go off to sleep. I had\na beard then and once she was a few months old I would place her on my lap and brush her hair with it.\nIt was a favourite father–daughter pastime and something both of us loved to do every day.\nWith a packed cricket calendar, which entailed me being away from home for long periods, it could\nnot have been easy for Anjali to bring up young Sara alone, but not once did she appear to resent this\nor ask me to spend more time at home. For my part, I know I found it difficult to leave my newborn\ndaughter. Every time I came back after a tour I could spot the changes in her and I was aware that I\nwas missing out on something truly special.\nThe first international destination that young Sara travelled to was New Zealand in December 1998.\nWe arrived in Napier to start with and the team were given comfortable serviced apartments to stay in.\nI  was  given  a  two-bedroom  apartment  and  it  was  decided  that Anjali  and  Sara  would  sleep  in  one\nbedroom  while  I  used  the  other.  Sara,  who  had  just  turned  one,  had  serious  trouble  adjusting  to  the\ntime  difference.  She  would  be  awake  all  night  and  would  expect Anjali  to  play  with  her  the  whole\ntime. I would put her to sleep all right, but then she would wake up an hour later and start wandering\nall over the apartment. Because I had to train or play a match the next day, there was no way I could\nstay up with her. As a result the responsibility fell on Anjali.\nAt one stage we were both finding it extremely tough to adjust and Anjali suggested that she would\nmuch rather return to India. It was difficult managing a toddler alone, having to cook, clean and wash\nher clothes, and when it was time to sleep she would be wide awake and ready to play. But then we\ntook her to the park to feed the ducks in the pond, which she loved, and that gave us so much joy that\nthe thought of going back was buried.\nThere is another story about Sara in New Zealand that I will never forget. The door to my bedroom\nwas always kept open so that Sara could come and go whenever she wanted. One morning Bhajji said\nto me that I ought to check if she had something in her mouth. I was surprised, because we had not\ngiven her anything. I had to persuade Sara to open her mouth for me and when she did I was shocked\nto see that she had four or five cherry stones in her mouth. She must have had them in there for at least\na few minutes, and had it not been for Bhajji there could have been a serious problem.\nThe  team  spent  Christmas  and  New Year  in  New  Zealand  in  1998–99  and  we  will  always  remain\ngrateful  to  two  expat  Indians  for  bailing  us  out  on  Christmas  Day.  None  of  us  had  an  idea  that\neverything  in  Wellington,  including  restaurants,  would  remain  shut  between  the  night  of  24  and  the\nmorning of 26 December. In India all restaurants and hotels are open on Christmas Day, with people\neating out to celebrate the occasion. In Wellington, even the team hotel would not serve food and the\nteam was left to fend for themselves. That’s when Mori Patel, Ilesh Patel and Nanu bhai came to our\nrescue.\nMori bhai, Ilesh bhai and Nanu bhai are residents of Wellington, and on Christmas Day they came\nover to our hotel with all sorts of amazing food. We all enjoyed feasting on the fantastic Indian food\nthat had been specially prepared for us. Apart from not starving on Christmas Day, it meant we could\nalso get a taste of fantastic home-cooked Indian food. Over the years, the Patels came to watch a lot of\nour games in New Zealand and sometimes even travelled to Australia to see us play. Each time they\nwould bring food and tea for us. Ilesh bhai’s desi chai (Indian tea) was a hit among the players and\neach time I saw him I would ask, ‘Ilesh bhai chai nahi pilayenge kya?’ (Ilesh bhai, would you not get\nus to drink tea today?)\nIt was in New Zealand that Sara started to speak. She said her first nursery rhyme in the course of\nthis tour and each word she said made me feel immensely fulfilled and delighted.\nA painful series\nWhile  I  was  gradually  adjusting  to  the  responsibilities  of  fatherhood,  I  suffered  my  first  serious\ninjury,  a  back  problem  from  which  I  took  more  than  eight  months  to  fully  recover.  The  problem\nsurfaced in Chennai at the end of January 1999 during the first Test against Pakistan.\nPakistan had come to India after a gap of thirteen years and the entire country was focused on the\ntwo-Test series and the Asian Test Championship involving India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka that was to\nfollow.  Pakistan  had  a  versatile  bowling  attack,  with  Wasim  Akram,  Waqar  Younis  and  the  off-\nspinner Saqlain Mushtaq, leg-spinner Shahid Afridi and slow left-arm orthodox spinner Nadeem Khan\nall in good form, and there was no doubt it would be a keenly contested series.\nThe Chennai match lived up to the hype and after three days of gripping Test cricket, India were left\nwith a target of 271 in the fourth innings. It was a difficult run chase, as Wasim and Waqar started out\nvery well for Pakistan, reducing us to 6–2 on the third evening. I walked out with just under an hour\nleft on the third day, with Wasim and Waqar still charging in and full of energy. Rahul was already\nout  there  and  we  knew  we  needed  to  see  out  the  rest  of  the  day  and  resume  battle  the  following\nmorning. These little sessions are always tricky because the bowling side know they can come back\nrefreshed the next morning and so they throw everything at the batsmen, in the hope of getting a bonus\nwicket. For the batting team there’s little to be gained and the priority is not to lose another wicket.\nWaqar  welcomed  me  to  the  crease  with  a  couple  of  bouncers  and  even  walked  up  to  me  on  one\noccasion to say, ‘Ball nazar aayi?’ (Did you see the ball?) I didn’t say a thing, but my eye contact was\nenough to give him the message. I hardly moved and he was soon walking back to his bowling mark. I\nremember  muttering  to  myself,  ‘You  are  not  bowling  that  quick,  my  friend.’  This  exchange  only\nhelped to strengthen my resolve and I was unbeaten on 20 at the end of play, determined to win the\nTest match on the fourth day.\nRahul was not out at the other end and there are not many other players you would rather bat with in\na situation like that. He has always been rock solid. The next morning, however, the usual script was\ntorn up when Rahul was bowled by a beauty from Wasim. Azhar soon followed and when Sourav got\nout we were down to 82–5 and badly needed a partnership.\nWhen  Nayan  Mongia  came  out  to  join  me  in  the  middle  I  asked  him  to  be  patient  and  just  play\nhimself in. With the cream of our batting back in the dressing room, I realized it was time for me to\ntake  charge.  I  was  fully  focused  on  the  job  at  hand  and  had  gone  into  a  zone  where  I  was  praying\nbefore each ball was bowled. Even when Nayan was on strike I was rehearsing in my mind how I’d\nhave  played  the  balls  bowled  to  him.  In  effect,  I  was  trying  to  bat  at  both  ends. As  I  concentrated\nreally hard, everything else around me seemed a blur and all I knew was that I had to bat through to\nthe end of the game.\nAnd then the pain struck. It was forty-five minutes before tea when I felt a scorching pain in my\nback. By now Nayan and I had put together a good partnership and the game was starting to tilt ever so\nslightly towards India. But Pakistan had yet to take the new ball and I knew we still had a fair amount\nof  work  to  do.  Wasim  and  Waqar  would  give  their  best  in  one  final  burst.  The  hot  and  humid\nconditions  in  Chennai  were  harsh  and  I  was  starting  to  suffer  from  cramp.  Playing  each  ball  was\nturning out to be an ordeal and the pain in my back was becoming unbearable. The tea break came as a\nblessed relief. I remember lying flat on a towel in the dressing room with cold towels spread all over\nme to bring down my body temperature. My whole body was cramping up and I knew it was going to\nbe really difficult to bat for two more hours.\nAfter tea I had no choice but to attack the bowling, because I knew my back was about to give up. I\ninformed  Nayan  of  the  change  in  strategy  and  hit  a  few  boundaries  in  the  next  few  overs.  Soon  the\ntarget was down to manageable proportions and we just needed to play out the second new ball. We\nhad put on 136 runs for the sixth wicket and Pakistan were gradually losing their grip on the match. In\nfact, we were cruising along when Nayan got out to a bad shot. He tried a slog to a Wasim delivery\nand top-edged the ball in the process. There was no need to play that shot and it had once again given\nPakistan a ray of hope. It was a sad end to a very good innings from Nayan.\nSunil Joshi, who came in next, settled well and even hit a six off Saqlain during his forty-minute\nstay at the wicket. We made 36 in the six overs after Nayan got out and the target was now just 17 runs\naway. In the meantime my back had all but given up on me and I was finding it difficult to stand up\nstraight. Every movement was hurting and every shot increased the pain. I soon realized that all-out\nattack was my only option. Unable to bear the pain any longer, I tried to hit a Saqlain doosra – the off-\nspinner’s delivery that goes the other way from normal after pitching, a ball that Saqlain was the first\nto master – over mid off for another boundary. The ball bounced more than expected and I ended up\ntop-edging the ball. I could see Wasim getting under the ball at mid off and was praying for him to\ndrop the catch. But I was out for 136 and was devastated.\nIt was a painful walk back to the pavilion. Even the standing ovation from the crowd did little to\nalleviate the pain at not having finished the match. However, I must say that I really did not expect us\nto lose the match from there, with just 17 runs to get and three wickets, including Srinath and Kumble,\nstill left. In fact, I couldn’t believe what was happening when we were bowled out for 258 and lost by\n12 runs. My world seemed to collapse around me and I just couldn’t hold back the tears in the dressing\nroom. My back was in horrible shape and mentally I was at a serious low.\nIt was the only time in my life when I didn’t go out to receive the Man of the Match award. Raj\nSingh Dungarpur tried to persuade me but I said to him that I was in no state, physically or mentally,\nto  leave  the  dressing  room.  He  understood  and  left  me  to  myself.  Even  when  we  were  leaving  for\nDelhi  the  next  morning,  I  couldn’t  even  carry  my  hand  luggage.  It  was  as  if  someone  was  sticking\nneedles into my back all the time and I couldn’t sit in one position for more than two or three minutes.\nIn  hindsight,  I  should  not  have  played  the  Delhi  and  Kolkata  Test  matches  that  followed,  but  my\nurge to play against Pakistan drove me on. I had told the BCCI all about my physical condition and\nthey had left it up to me whether to play or not and at the time I felt I would be able push myself.\nThe second Test, starting in Delhi on 4 February 1999, was very much Anil Kumble’s match and it\nwas his world-record spell of 10–74 in the second innings that helped us level the series. Anil has won\nmany  Test  matches  for  India  and  he  was  unplayable  at  the  Kotla  in  Delhi,  as  he  became  only  the\nsecond bowler in the history of Test cricket, after Jim Laker in 1956, to pick up all ten wickets in an\ninnings.  In  Pakistan’s  second  innings  I  handed Anil’s  sweater  and  cap  to  umpire Arani  Jayaprakash\nbefore every over he bowled. It worked well for us and there was no reason to change the pattern. It\nseems  incredible  to  think  that  Anil  singlehandedly  won  us  a  Test  match  against  Pakistan,  but  he\ncertainly did.\nThe two-Test series was followed by the Asian Test Championship and India played Pakistan in the\ninaugural match of this new competition at Eden Gardens in Kolkata, which started on 16 February.\nMany looked upon it as the third and deciding leg of the bilateral series. I remember the match for the\nway I was run out in the second innings. Chasing 279 for victory, we were well placed at 134–2 when I\nwalked out to bat. I was in the process of playing myself in when I clipped a Wasim delivery past wide\nmid on. The ball was finally pulled up yards from the rope by the substitute fielder Nadeem Khan. I\nwas jogging to the crease for an easy third run when the throw came in on the full to hit the stumps.\nDespite the direct hit, I would have been well in if I hadn’t collided with Shoaib Akhtar. Shoaib, who\nwas fielding at mid off, had come forward to back up the throw and was standing a few yards behind\nthe stumps, right in my line of running. I could not comprehend why he was standing there rather than\nright behind the stumps. With my eyes on the ball, I collided with him moments after I had run my bat\nin. As a result of the collision, my bat was in the air when the ball hit the stumps.\nWhile not imputing any motive to Shoaib, I must say I was shocked to see the Pakistanis appeal for\nthe  run-out.  The  crowd,  sensing  the  injustice,  turned  violent  and  started  throwing  things  onto  the\nground. After walking off, finding it difficult to come to terms with the incident, I went straight to the\nthird umpire’s room to check the replay and was dismayed to see what had really happened.\nBecause  of  the  crowd  disturbance,  the  match  had  to  be  stopped  for  a  good  twenty  minutes,  and\nfinally  Jagmohan  Dalmiya,  then  president  of  the  ICC  and  one  of  India’s  most  distinguished\nadministrators,  came  to  our  dressing  room  to  ask  if  I  would  go  out  and  pacify  the  crowd.  I  didn’t\nreally  feel  like  it,  because  I  felt  wronged,  but  I  changed  my  mind  to  ensure  there  was  no  further\nviolence at Eden Gardens. It was only after Jagmohan Dalmiya and I appealed to the crowd that the\nmatch was finally allowed to resume.\nThe  sense  of  outrage,  however,  was  still  there  and  the  crowd  turned  violent  again  the  following\nmorning, resulting in unreal scenes towards the end of the match. In an unprecedented move, 65,000\npeople  were  forced  to  vacate  the  stadium  and  the  match  was  completed  without  a  single  spectator\ninside  the  ground.  Perhaps  it  could  all  have  been  avoided  if  Shoaib  had  not  stood  in  my  way  or  if\nWasim had withdrawn the appeal.\nIndia lost the Test match by 46 runs and the way the match ended left us all feeling rather bitter.\nLosing my father\nContinuing to play on with my back injury had unfortunately aggravated the problem. As a result, I\nplayed the World Cup in England in May and June 1999 in considerable physical discomfort. But the\nWorld Cup was not a tournament I could miss and I did all I could to get ready. Every time I trained,\nmy back would get stiff and I would need a cooling-off period for it to settle down. The fickle English\nweather did not help matters and I was advised to sleep on the floor of the hotel room with a pillow\nbelow my knee, to make sure that my back was flat on the ground. In time, I learnt to sleep in the tiny\ngap between the bed and the cupboard in most hotel rooms, which ensured there wasn’t much space\nfor me to toss and turn.\nAjit, Anjali and Sara were all in England before the World Cup and that was a great comfort. We\nwould go out for meals together and it was during one of these dinners at a Chinese restaurant that I\nordered  crispy  aromatic  duck.  I  just  love  to  eat  this  dish  served  with  thin  pancakes  and  sliced\ncucumber and can finish a portion on my own. However, just as I placed my order, Ajit asked me to\ncancel it. He declared that he would not allow me to eat duck before the World Cup. While I found it\namusing at first, I soon realized he was serious and felt obliged to do what he wanted. When I asked\nhim his reasons, he said he had read an article which said that three English players had once gone out\nfor a meal before a very important match and they had all had duck for dinner. Subsequently each one\ngot out without scoring. Of course, in cricket a ‘duck’ is associated with a batsman scoring zero and\non  the  Australian  television  coverage  a  duck  is  even  shown  accompanying  a  batsman  back  to  the\npavilion if he gets out without scoring. Ajit said to me I could have as much duck as I wanted once the\nWorld Cup was over!\nJust before the tournament started Anjali decided to go back to London, leaving me to focus solely\non  my  cricket.  In  the  second  trimester  of  her  pregnancy  and  with  one-and-a-half-year-old  Sara  with\nher, it must have been immensely difficult for her to negotiate things on her own. While I missed her\nbadly and desperately wanted to be with her to help out, there was little I could do but appreciate what\nshe was doing for me and the family.\nIt was in the middle of all this that I received the news of my father’s passing. Ajit, who had gone\nback to India by then, called Anjali to tell her what had happened and asked her to break the news to\nme personally. Anjali in turn called two of my team-mates, Robin Singh and Ajay Jadeja, and asked\nthem to be outside my room as she drove back to the team hotel in Leicester very late at night on 18\nMay  –  the  day  before  our  second  match  of  the  tournament,  against  Zimbabwe.  She  also  called  the\nhotel manager and asked him not to transfer any calls to my room.\nWhen  I  opened  the  door  at  well  past  midnight  and  saw  her  standing  with  Ajay  and  Robin  I\nimmediately  sensed  something  serious  had  happened. Atul  Ranade,  one  of  my  closest  friends,  was\nwith me in my room and I asked Atul to go out as Anjali came in. I could not believe what she was\nsaying. It was a cruel blow and not something I had expected at all. It left me numb for a few minutes.\nI could not say a thing. Father had always been there for me. My mind had stopped working and all I\ncould do was hold Anjali and cry. I felt helpless and was unable to come to terms with the shock for a\nwhile.\nMy first thought was to go back to India at the earliest opportunity to be with my mother and see\nmy father one final time. Mark Mascarenhas, as always, had already made all the arrangements for the\nfollowing morning and drove the two of us to Heathrow just before dawn. All through the journey I\nkept thinking about my father, who had been in reasonable health when I had left India for the World\nCup. In fact, I couldn’t believe he was not alive and felt that if I went back to India he would open his\neyes again. He had undergone angioplasty a few months earlier and had stayed with us, so that Anjali\ncould take care of him. By the time I left for the World Cup, he seemed back to his normal self and\nhad even started to climb three floors. The doctors had asked him to have a drink every evening and I\nmade a point of coming home most evenings to share a drink with him. In my wildest dreams I had\nnever imagined that I would be sharing a drink with my father, but medical advice had forced me to do\nso. The thought that I would never see him again was just too much to digest.\nMy brothers and friends had come to pick me up at Mumbai airport but this was a very different\nhomecoming from normal. When I got home I could see that my mother had aged considerably in the\npast few days and was sitting facing the wall. She hardly said a word to anyone and was in a state of\nshock. I felt devastated to see my mother like that and what was more worrying was that she did not\nmove from her position for close to two days. It became unbearable when I came face to face with my\ngrandmother, who had lost her son. She said to me that she wanted to spend a few quiet minutes with\nhim and I immediately asked all who were present to leave us alone for a while. I accompanied my\ngrandmother  to  the  room  where  my  father’s  body  was  lying,  then  left  her  to  mourn  with  her  son  in\npeace. I remember standing a good few yards away, giving her the space she needed.\nI couldn’t sleep for many nights having lost my biggest inspiration. And it was a deeply emotional\nmoment for all of us when the watchmen, postmen and all the other people he had helped during his\nlife came over for his funeral. I put a gold coin with my face on it in his pocket before the cremation,\nso that I could always be there with him.\nWithout my father, my life would never be the same again.\nA very difficult tournament\nAfter  spending  four  days  in  India,  I  returned  to  England  to  rejoin  the  team  on  the  eve  of  the  match\nagainst  Kenya.  That,  it  seemed  to  me,  was  what  my  father  would  have  wanted  me  to  do,  and  that’s\nwhat prompted the decision to return to London to play the remaining World Cup matches. Mentally,\nhowever,  I  was  not  at  my  best  throughout  the  tournament.  I  had  to  wear  dark  glasses  during  the\npractice  sessions,  because  at  times  I  could  not  hold  back  my  tears.  Though  I  managed  to  score  a\nhundred  in  the  match  against  Kenya  –  which  remains  one  of  my  most  cherished  centuries,  one  I\ndedicated to my father – my mind was not always on the game.\nThe  back  injury,  which  had  not  shown  any  signs  of  improvement,  also  continued  to  bother  me\nthroughout  the  rest  of  the  World  Cup,  helping  to  make  it  one  of  the  toughest  tournaments  I  have\nplayed  in.  It  wasn’t  India’s  best  World  Cup  either  and  we  were  knocked  out  in  the  Super  Six  stage\nafter winning a couple of memorable matches against Sri Lanka and England at the group stage.\nAgainst Sri Lanka at Taunton on 26 May 1999, Sourav and Rahul played two of the finest innings I\nhave  seen  in  a  World  Cup.  Sourav  was  at  his  elegant  best  on  his  way  to  a  majestic  183  and  Rahul\nplayed beautifully for his 145. In our next match against England on 29 May, Sourav yet again made a\nsignificant  all-round  contribution,  to  give  us  a  much-needed  win,  and  Rahul  was  consistent  right\nthrough the tournament.\nAt  the  Super  Six  stage  our  only  consolation  was  another  win  against  Pakistan.  The  match  had\nassumed  great  significance  against  the  backdrop  of  strained  political  relations  between  the  two\ncountries – the war in Kargil in Kashmir was on at the time. India won the highly charged encounter\nby 47 runs, with Venkatesh Prasad picking up a five-wicket haul.\nAn unexpected appointment\nThe  back  pain  continued  to  bother  me  after  the  World  Cup  and  in  fact  turned  worse  in  the  twin\ntournaments in Sri Lanka and Singapore in August–September 1999, at the end of which I decided to\ngo to Australia to get my back examined. I had already resorted to acupuncture and acupressure – and\neven had my tongue pricked by an expert in Singapore trying to identify the pressure points that might\nhelp in the recovery. They were the acts of an increasingly desperate man.\nDr Anant  Joshi,  one  of  India’s  leading  doctors  and  one  who  has  always  been  there  for  me  right\nthrough my career, travelled with me to Adelaide in September 1999 to meet a number of specialists.\nA series of checks were conducted and I eventually received four injections for the injury. I was glad I\ncould not see the injections at the time because afterwards I realized I had never seen bigger needles\nin my life. I actually carried one back to show my friends and family and nobody could believe the\nsize of them. But they did the job, and soon after my return to India the back injury that had bothered\nme for eight months was finally sorted. It was certainly a relief to be pain-free.\nMy determination was even greater because in August 1999 I had been appointed captain of India\nagain, despite having deep reservations about taking on the job for a second time. What happened was\nthat Ajit Wadekar had come to my house to ask me if I was prepared to captain India again and I told\nhim that I was reluctant to do so. The next I heard was that I had been appointed captain ahead of a tri-\nseries in Sri Lanka in August. It appears that Wadekar Sir had come over to speak to me on behalf of\nthe  BCCI  and  it  was  after  consultation  with  him  that  the  selectors  had  decided  to  give  me  the\nresponsibility, despite my unwillingness. Once the appointment was made public it was difficult for\nme to turn it down. I have never ducked a challenge and I went on to accept the job, determined to\ngive it my best. We were due to tour Australia at the end of the year and I knew it was the toughest\nassignment in cricket at the time.\nA new arrival\nAll of this coincided with the birth of our second child, when Anjali and I were blessed with a baby\nboy on 24 September 1999. I decided to name him Arjun and remember announcing my intention to\nAnjali soon after I had seen my son for the first time. She later mentioned to me that she had thought\nof a few other names herself but, seeing my enthusiasm for Arjun, went ahead with my choice. Once\nagain I filmed the day and I cherish the recording of Arjun being brought out to me for the first time.\nWatching the children grow up is a fantastic feeling and I must say I missed them every time I was\naway  from  them.  With Arjun  it  was  particularly  hard.  He  would  resent  my  going  away  and  would\nrefuse to speak to me on the phone. For the first six years of his life Arjun never talked to me when I\nwas on tour. In my desperation to hear his voice I often requested Anjali to ask him to say hello, but\nhe would always refuse. Then, on my return, he would cling to me for the first three days, trying to\nmake up for lost time.\nWhile Sara did not seem to resent my going in the same way as Arjun, she did find it difficult on\noccasions to bond with me on my return. Sara was just a few months old when I had to travel to Sri\nLanka for a tour. It was extremely hot in Colombo and I returned home with quite a tan at the end of\nthe assignment. I had turned really dark and she didn’t recognize me. She thought someone else had\nwalked in and she refused to go near me for the first few minutes!\nWhen I had my kids at the turn of the century, technology was not as advanced as now and there\nwas no option to use Skype or FaceTime. Had the technology been available, I’m sure I would have\nasked Anjali to bring Sara and Arjun in front of the webcam so that I could at least see my kids when I\nwas  off  in  some  other  part  of  the  world.  It  would  have  meant  not  missing  out  on  so  many  of  the\nchanges they went through.\nNew Zealand in India, October–November 1999\nAfter  a  couple  of  weeks  at  home  following Arjun’s  birth,  I  was  back  on  the  field  at  Mohali  on  10\nOctober captaining India against New Zealand in the first of three Tests. Just like the first time, the\nstart to my captaincy was not too bad, as we beat New Zealand in the series, though we made it hard\nfor  ourselves  in  the  very  first  innings  at  Mohali  when  we  were  bowled  out  for  83,  with  Dion  Nash\ntaking six wickets. It was just one of those days when nothing worked and we collapsed for one of our\nlowest  ever  scores  on  home  soil.  It  seemed  as  if  the  ghost  of  Barbados  was  back  to  haunt  me.  This\ntime, however, our bowlers did a good job restricting the Kiwis to 215 and we batted with a lot more\ndiscipline  in  the  second  innings.  We  scored  505,  losing  just  three  wickets,  with  both  Rahul  and  me\nscoring hundreds, and the game ended in a draw.\nThe second innings, however, was not without incident. Chris Cairns, the New Zealand all-rounder,\nbowled a spell of excellent reverse swing. Part of the problem for Rahul and me was that he concealed\nthe shiny side of the ball so well that there was no way for the batsman to work out which way the ball\nwould swing. That’s when I came up with a plan. I suggested to Rahul that while it was impossible for\nthe striker, it was not so difficult for the non-striker to work it out as he was far closer to Cairns. It\nwas decided that while standing at the non-striker’s end, I would spot the shiny side and if it was on\nthe outside of the ball, I would hold my bat in my left hand to indicate to Rahul that the ball would\nswing away from him. If the shiny side was on the inside, I would hold my bat in my right hand to\nindicate that the ball would be coming in to him. And if I was not able to figure out which way the ball\nwould swing, I would hold my bat in the middle.\nThe plan worked surprisingly well and soon we were able to attack Cairns, who ended up going for\n76 runs in his twenty-four overs without picking up a wicket. It took a while for Cairns to work out\nwhat we were doing. To catch us unawares, he decided to bowl a cross-seam delivery, so I held my bat\nin  the  middle  to  indicate  to  Rahul  that  I  didn’t  know  which  way  the  ball  would  swing.  Soon  after\ndelivering the ball, Cairns turned towards me to see what I was doing. He was angry and frustrated and\nwanted to know how I had reacted to him bowling a cross-seam delivery. Winning this battle against\nChris Cairns definitely helped us save the match.\nIn the second Test match, at Kanpur, we beat New Zealand comprehensively, with Kumble picking\nup ten wickets in the game, and in the final Test at Ahmedabad I scored a double hundred in a drawn\nencounter. At Ahmedabad we scored a mammoth 583 runs in the first innings and, despite bowling the\nopposition  out  for  308,  did  not  enforce  the  follow-on.  This  was  a  unanimous  decision  taken  in\nconsultation with the fast bowlers, who were tired after an exhausting first-innings effort and needed\nsome rest before they bowled again. We won the series 1–0 and then went on to win the ODI series 3–\n2. It may not have been ideal preparation for the tour to Australia that started at the end of the month,\nbut a series win never does any harm.\nIndia in Australia, November 1999–January 2000\nDuring my second stint as captain we had Kapil Dev as our coach. He is one of the finest cricketers to\nhave played for India and one of the best all-rounders of all time, and I had great expectations of him\nin Australia. I have always maintained that the coach’s job is an important one, for he is in a position\nto play a key role in formulating team strategy. Who better than Kapil to come up with options for me\nduring  a  tough  tour  of Australia?  However,  his  method  of  involvement  and  his  thought  process  was\nlimited  to  leaving  the  running  of  the  team  to  the  captain,  and  hence  he  did  not  involve  himself  in\nstrategic discussions that would help us on the field.\nThings  did  not  start  badly  for  us  in  Australia.  Unlike  in  South  Africa  in  1996–97,  we  reached\nAustralia a good two weeks before the series started and played three practice games before the first\nTest. All in all, we weren’t underprepared when we walked onto the field at the Adelaide Oval on 10\nDecember 1999, and if the first morning was anything to go by, we were in with a good chance against\nthe best team in the world.\nJavagal  Srinath  and  Venkatesh  Prasad  bowled  extremely  well  to  reduce Australia  to  52–4  before\nlunch and we needed just one more wicket to get into the Australian lower middle order. We almost\nhad that wicket in the form of the always dangerous Ricky Ponting, but he was given not out to a very\nclose lbw shout early in his innings. He escaped again when he clearly under-edged a ball from Ajit\nAgarkar to the wicketkeeper MSK Prasad when on 62 but was again not adjudged out. Australia were\nstill not out of the woods at that stage and that could well have been the opening we were looking for.\nHowever,  luck  was  with  Ponting  on  the  day  and  he  and  Steve  Waugh  both  went  on  to  make  big\nhundreds.\nWhen  it  was  our  turn  to  bat,  I  faced  a  probing  spell  from  Glenn  McGrath  towards  the  end  of  the\nday’s play, playing out five or six maiden overs in the process. Some people may have wondered why\nI  allowed  McGrath  to  bowl  those  maidens  and  why  I  was  not  playing  my  natural  game,  but  Test\ncricket is all about getting into the mind of the opposition. After that passage of play, the  Australians\nchanged their tactics, and later Shane Warne told me that I had forced them to make the change. The\nAustralian plan, I was told, was to make me leave 70 per cent of the deliveries in each innings. But\nwith me playing out the maiden overs, they realized that attempts to frustrate me wouldn’t work. The\nnext morning, I changed my strategy and hit McGrath for two boundaries in the first over.\nIn this Test match we were at the receiving end of what seemed to us to be a howler from umpire\nDaryl Harper. Sourav and I had embarked on a good fightback and I had scored 61. The team score\nwas  at  215–4  and  another  hundred  runs  could  have  helped  set  up  the  match,  but  just  as  we  were\nlooking to consolidate, Daryl Harper gave me out bat-pad to Shane Warne, caught by Justin Langer at\nforward short leg. I was sure I hadn’t hit the ball. Warne had pitched the delivery on my legs and the\nball simply hit the pad before being caught by Langer. In the second innings I felt I was unlucky again.\nGlenn McGrath tried to bounce one at me but the ball actually stayed low. I instinctively ducked and it\nhit me on my shoulder. To everyone’s surprise, umpire Harper declared me out lbw. It was a strange\ndecision, because there was surely no way it would have gone on to hit the stumps.\nWhile  I’m  not  trying  to  excuse  our  under-par  performance,  there’s  no  doubt  that  those  decisions\nplayed  a  huge  role  in  such  a  hard-fought  Test  match.  To Australia’s  credit,  they  capitalized  on  the\nopportunities  and  went  1–0  up  as  a  result.  In  the  second  and  third  Tests  of  the  series,  however,  we\nwere comprehensively outplayed. Even when VVS Laxman produced a magical 167 in Sydney in the\nthird Test, something that prompted me to ask the selectors to keep him back for the ODI series that\nfollowed,  the  result  was  never  in  doubt.  McGrath  and  Brett  Lee,  who  made  his  debut  in  the  series,\nwere exceptional and had great back-up in Damien Fleming and Shane Warne. We were never allowed\nto take charge and there’s no harm in conceding that Steve Waugh’s Australian team in 1999 was one\nof the best teams I ever played against.\nPersonally I had a pretty good series and batted well for a hundred at the MCG in the Boxing Day\nTest.  However,  it  counted  for  nothing  because  I  was  not  able  to  change  the  fortunes  of  the  team. A\nhundred  in  a  losing  cause  is  something  of  a  bitter  pill.  Even  in  the  second  innings  I  scored  52  and\nwhile it was a personal milestone, it was not enough to save the game.\nAfter the 3–0 defeat in the Test series we lost the ODI tri-series with Pakistan and Australia, failing\neven to make the final. The tour had gone from bad to worse and I was deeply frustrated. On my way\nback to India I was going through serious mental turmoil. I was finding it difficult to unwind. In the\npast I had been able to leave the disappointments of cricket behind and switch off. Not this time. Even\nwhen I was with my kids, my mind was still on the series. I was unable to figure out what I was doing\nwrong. I was failing to get the team to play to their potential and it was all starting to get to me.\nAs a batsman, I was accountable for my own mistakes and could do what was required to sort out\nmy flaws and get back to form. As a captain it was not. As skipper, I was responsible for the actions of\nmy team-mates, but I couldn’t control everything they did. For example, sometimes I carefully put a\nplan in place but it was simply not implemented, which I found hard to cope with.\nThe ODI against Pakistan in Brisbane on 10 January 2000 is a case in point. It was a low-scoring\ngame and we had made 195 batting first in our fifty overs. Pakistan, docked an over for a slow over\nrate, were reduced to 71–6 at one point in their innings. Clearly, we should have closed out the match\nfrom  that  position.  Eventually,  however,  Pakistan  won  the  match  off  the  last  ball,  with  Saqlain\nMushtaq and Waqar Younis taking the team over the line with an unbeaten 43-run stand for the ninth\nwicket.\nThe defeat particularly hurt me because I had predicted what the Pakistani batsmen were planning\nin the final stages of the innings. While fielding at mid off, I had repeatedly spoken to my fast bowlers\nand had specifically asked them not to bowl a slower ball without informing me. Despite my repeated\nwarnings, one of them bowled a slower ball without the proper field in place and the Pakistan batsman\npromptly  dispatched  it  to  the  boundary.  Such  incidents  caused  me  immense  frustration  and  I  was\nfinding it increasingly difficult to get them out of my mind.\nOver to Sourav\nEven  before  the  start  of  the Australia  series,  I  had  spoken  to  the  selectors  about  appointing  Sourav\nGanguly as my deputy. I had always felt he had the ability to lead the team in my absence. If I got\ninjured in Australia or had to leave the field temporarily, I wanted Sourav to be in charge of the side.\nWithin weeks of coming back from Australia I had communicated to BCCI president AC Muthiah\nand the selection committee that I did not want to continue as captain. It was in the best interests of\nthe team to pass the baton to Sourav and focus on my batting. At the same time, we did not want to\nspring the Indian captaincy on him and leave him unsettled. He needed a little time to come to terms\nwith the pressures and it was my responsibility to ensure that the transition was smooth. So I informed\nthe selectors that I was happy to lead the side in the two home Tests against South Africa in February\n2000. It was agreed that Sourav would take over after the Test series and before the start of the five-\nmatch ODI series.\nI had discussed my decision with my family in Lonavla, where we had gone for a break. They were\nall in agreement that the frustration of not achieving what I wanted with the team was affecting me\nbadly and that I was pushing myself too hard. Anjali knew how I was feeling and I also spoke to Ajit\nat length about what I was going through.\nNever again\nAfter giving up the captaincy at the start of 2000, I never captained India again. That is not to say I\nwasn’t given the choice of captaining the team later in my career. I was actually offered the job quite a\nfew times but was never tempted. One occasion was soon after Rahul Dravid stepped down after the\ntour of England in September 2007.\nThe final time I was offered the job was at the end of Anil’s captaincy in late 2008. We were in the\nmiddle  of  a  home  series  against  Australia  and  Anil’s  retirement  had  left  a  huge  void.  This  time  I\nrecommended  MS  Dhoni.  Earlier  I  had  recommended  him  as  captain  for  the  Twenty20  World  Cup,\nand Test captaincy was a natural progression.\nDhoni had already captained the team with distinction in the Twenty20 format and had also done\nwell in the fifty-over format. He was one of the few players who played all formats of the game and\nread  the  game  well  at  critical  times.  Having  discussed  things  with  him  when  fielding  in  the  slip\ncordon, I knew he was a good choice for the job and had little hesitation in putting his name forward.\nHe had age on his side and would be able to guide Indian cricket into the future.\nAll of the people I recommended or played under after giving up the captaincy – Sourav Ganguly,\nRahul Dravid, Anil Kumble or MS Dhoni – I had a good relationship with, and when I felt it necessary\nI would give them my opinion and then leave it to them to take the final call. As a senior player in the\nside, I felt it was my job to give the captain options, as he had way too much on his plate and it was\nsometimes  easy  to  miss  things.  I  loved  being  involved  and  they  all  seemed  to  welcome  my\ncontributions.  The  final  decision  was  always  the  captain’s,  but  I  felt  it  was  important  for  me  to  let\nthem know what I thought was best for the team.\nEvery  captain  I  played  under  had  his  respective  strengths.  Sourav  was  an  excellent  strategist  and\nhad  a  very  good  understanding  of  the  game.  He  was  an  aggressive  captain  and  wasn’t  afraid  to\nexperiment in difficult situations. It was under Sourav that we started winning overseas Test matches\nconsistently.\nAnil Kumble was an excellent communicator and clearly explained to the players what he wanted\nfrom  each  of  them.  He  was  aggressive  and  trusted  his  instincts.  Sourav  and  Anil  were  both  great\nplayers and equally capable leaders.\nRahul,  on  the  other  hand,  was  more  conventional.  He  was  more  methodical  and  his  mental\ntoughness was an added strength. He was committed to the job but stayed away from experimenting\ntoo much. Dhoni, in contrast, was impulsive and loved to back his instincts. He has a really good grasp\nof  the  game  and  is  not  afraid  to  try  something  different.  He  is  never  flustered  and  handles  pressure\nwell. Under these men India won some big series and tournaments and I enjoyed playing with them\nall.\nAmong  the  captains  I  played  against,  I  consider  Nasser  Hussain  the  best.  He  was  an  excellent\nstrategist and even if some of his tactics occasionally bordered on the negative – using the left-arm\nspinner Ashley Giles to bowl to me outside my leg stump from over the wicket, for example – he was\na very good thinker about the game and was proactive. Nasser would not place a fielder in a particular\nposition after  a  shot  was  played.  Rather,  he  had  the  ability  to  anticipate  the  shot  and  would  place  a\nfielder well in advance, making a real difference to his team.\nAmong the Australians, I rate Michael Clarke as the best captain I played against. While I was too\nyoung to judge Allan Border in 1992, the other Australian captains in Mark Taylor, Steve Waugh and\nRicky  Ponting  benefited  from  having  some  of  the  greatest  players  of  our  generation  in  their  teams.\nWith so many match-winners, the role of the captain is automatically reduced. Clarke’s case, however,\nwas different. He had to rebuild the Australian team from scratch and to do so in such a short time\nspeaks volumes for his ability as leader.\nGraeme Smith of South Africa is yet another player I have great regard for as skipper. Taking over\nthe  reins  of  the  side  at  the  age  of  twenty-two  in  the  most  tumultuous  of  conditions,  Smith  did\nbrilliantly to propel South Africa to the top of the world Test rankings.\nLooking back at my own captaincy career, I feel I could have achieved better results during my first\nstint as captain had there been more cooperation. I never felt totally comfortable with the relationship\nwith  the  selectors.  This  was  reflected  in  the  teams  I  was  given,  which  were  not  always  the  ones  I\nwould have chosen. In my first stint as captain of India, it seemed that each series was a personal test\nand  losing  one  series  badly  meant  my  position  was  immediately  in  question.  Such  pressure  did  not\nalways send out the best signal and it was as if I was constantly being evaluated. Every captain sets\nout to win but it’s not always possible to do so in international sport. The opposition were also playing\nto win and at times they simply played better cricket than we did. That was the case in Australia in\nDecember 1999.\nThere  is  no  point  lamenting  what  could  have  been.  It  was  time  to  look  beyond  the  captaincy  and\ncontribute to the team in the best way possible. I am glad I was able to do so for a good thirteen years\nafter giving up the captaincy in February 2000.\nThe difficulty of being a Tendulkar\nThere is a common misconception that cricketers’ families have an easy time of it. On the contrary, in\nmy absence Anjali had to do most of the parenting, and bringing up two young kids almost on her own\nwas anything but easy. For the children too it was hard at times. They were not always able to do the\nthings  normal  kids  enjoy  and,  with  their  father  away  for  long  periods,  they  missed  out  on  fatherly\naffection and care.\nWhen Arjun  was  just  nine  months  old,  for  example,  I  was  going  to  Germany  to  visit  the Adidas\nfactory and asked Anjali if she would like to come along. I was going for only five days and Anjali\nhadn’t  left  home  for  nine  months  –  after Arjun’s  birth.  We  left  Sara  and Arjun  with  her  parents  in\nIndia. It was on the third night away that calamity struck. We had finished work in the Adidas factory\nand  had  retreated  to  a  small  village  for  the  evening  when  Anjali  got  a  call  from  Dr  Ajit\nGajendragadkar,  who  asked  us  to  come  back  as  soon  as  possible.  We  were  informed  that  Anjali’s\nmother  had  suffered  a  brain  haemorrhage  (from  which  she  later  recovered)  and  was  in  the  hospital\nunconscious, while Arjun was seriously sick at home.\nIt was night-time in Germany and the earliest we could leave for India was the following morning.\nAll through the journey the next day we kept worrying about who was taking care of nine-month-old\nArjun. When we finally got home, the first sight of Arjun reduced us both to tears. He had lost weight\nand had a pained expression in his eyes. While there was a glint of happiness in seeing us both back at\nhome,  his  expression  was  predominantly  one  of  hurt,  as  if  to  ask  why  we  had  to  leave  him  and  go\naway. Since then, Anjali has never left the kids alone at home to travel abroad with me.\nAnother example occurred soon after we had been knocked out of the World Cup in the Caribbean\nin March 2007. We had played poorly in the tournament and it was a low for the country. My family\nwere  aware  that  the  repercussions  of  the  first-round  exit  might  reach  the  kids.  As  a  precautionary\nmeasure, Anjali tried to explain to Arjun, who was seven years old at the time, that if someone made a\nsnide  comment  about  his  dad  at  school,  he  should  ignore  it;  he  should  just  say  that  it  was\ndisappointing  and  we  would  surely  do  better  the  next  time.  When  a  friend  of  his  accosted  him  at\nschool  and  said  that  India  had  lost  because  his  dad  had  got  out  for  zero,  our  advice  went  out  of  his\nhead and Arjun punched the boy and told him not to say anything bad about his father again.\nWhile  Sara  is  interested  in  studying  science, Arjun,  who  started  with  football,  now  wants  to  play\ncricket. I am perfectly happy with them doing whatever they want to do. In the last few years Sara has\nchanged perceptibly and has started taking far more responsibility. Anjali has allowed her the freedom\nto  shape  her  timetable  and  she  is  showing  signs  of  maturity.  She  went  to  Oxford  in  the  summer  of\n2012 for her summer school and is happy pursuing her dream of becoming a doctor. I’d be delighted\nto see her do so and have always felt that the best thing for parents is to allow kids to chase their own\ndreams. That’s what I did and it’s what I want my daughter to do as well.\nArjun, on the other hand, is deeply passionate about cricket. Mind you, he and I hardly ever spoke\nabout the game till he turned seven. I would chat with him about everything else but never talk cricket\nat home. This was an attempt to keep my professional world separate; I found it often helped to keep\nthe two spheres distinct from each other. So much so that my wife and children have hardly ever come\nto the stadium to watch me play. Anjali has been to the stadium just a handful of times in her life. The\nfirst time she saw me bat was at Edgbaston in 1996 when I scored a hundred. She was with her father\nat  the  time.  The  second  time  was  in  Melbourne  in  2004,  when  I  was  out  for  a  first-ball  duck.\nThereafter,  she  didn’t  come  to  the  stadium  again  till  my  199th  Test  match  at  Eden  Gardens  in\nNovember 2013. Instead, she had a special seat at home for watching matches on TV and refused to\nspeak to anyone or take phone calls when I was batting. That was her way of being with me the whole\ntime.\nArjun has come to my games frequently, however, and has travelled with me to England, Australia\nand South Africa. Arjun got seriously attracted to cricket after watching India win the inaugural world\nTwenty20 in September 2007. We watched the matches together at home and he was hugely inspired\nto see the Indian triumph in South Africa.\nMany have asked me if I feel added pressure at Arjun trying to become a cricketer. I really don’t. I\nam happy that he is trying to do something he enjoys, for that in itself will make him really happy.\nAlso  there  is  nothing  negative  about  playing  a  sport.  While  it  is  never  possible  to  guarantee\nperformance, one can guarantee the effort put in and there’s no doubt that he is putting his best foot\nforward. I am not concerned with how far he goes with his game, but am happy that he is doing his\nbest to excel in what he loves. I firmly believe that you take to playing cricket only if you are madly in\nlove with it. And that’s what has happened with Arjun over the last few years. There’s no doubt there\nwill be pressure on him every time he plays. But he has chosen what he wants to do and will have to\ndeal with that pressure as best he can.\nIndia in New Zealand 1998–99\n1st Test.

            "title": "THE BEST SERIES EVER\n",
            "data": "India started well under Sourav, winning the ODI series 3–2 against South Africa in March 2000. But\nsoon afterwards cricket plummeted to a low in the wake of the match-fixing scandal. The credibility\nof the game had been compromised and I found the revelations about matches being thrown for money\ndistasteful and disgusting. The whole thing was repulsive and what was seriously worrying was that\nfans  had  started  to  lose  faith  and  the  integrity  of  our  sport  was  in  doubt.  We  desperately  needed  to\nbring  credibility  back  to  the  game  and  we  hoped  that  we  could  do  so  in  the  course  of  playing  the\nAustralians at home in a much-anticipated Test series in February–March 2001. It would allow fans to\nmove away from the sordid tales of corruption and focus on the real thing: quality Test cricket.\nAt the time, Steve Waugh’s Australian team were hammering opposition teams both at home and\naway.  They  had  won  fifteen  Test  matches  in  a  row  when  they  landed  in  India.  In  Glenn  McGrath,\nJason Gillespie, Damien Fleming, Michael Kasprowicz and Shane Warne they had a bowling line-up\ncapable of taking wickets in all conditions. The batting was also exceptional, with Matthew Hayden,\nMichael Slater, Justin Langer, the Waugh twins, Ricky Ponting and Adam Gilchrist all in good form.\nA few months before the Australia series my family had relocated from Sahitya Sahawas to our new\nhaven, an apartment at La Mer Residency in Mumbai’s Bandra West, a move to which I contributed\nvery  little,  I  have  to  confess.  It  was Anjali  who  organized  everything  and  all  I  did  was  walk  into  a\nsprawling apartment with all my things beautifully set up for me.\nOn the morning of 26 January 2001, just ten months after we had moved into the new apartment, I\nheard Anjali screaming in fear, yelling ‘Earthquake!’ The building was swaying from side to side and\nmy  first  thought  was  that  the  builder  must  have  messed  up  with  the  construction.  However,  within\nmoments I realized that it was far more serious than that and people from nearby buildings were all\nscreaming  ‘Bhago,  bhago!’  (Run,  run!)  Because  we  were  on  the  tenth  and  eleventh  floors,  it  would\nhave taken us a few minutes to walk down with two kids, so all we did was stand in the middle of the\ndrawing room, huddled together as a family, praying for the catastrophe to stop.\nThe  earthquake  that  rocked  Western  India  lasted  less  than  a  minute,  but  it  left  devastation  in  its\nwake. The town of Bhuj in Gujarat was almost destroyed and we in Mumbai did not escape unscathed.\nFrom  my  bedroom  at  La  Mer  I  could  see  Mount  Mary  Church  on  the  one  side  and  Siddhivinayak\nTemple  on  the  other  and  for  days  after  the  earthquake  I  would  pray  at  night,  urging  God  never  to\nunleash such wrath on us again.\nIn  fact,  even  when  I  played  a  Duleep  Trophy  match  in  Pune  for  West  Zone  against  East  Zone  in\nearly February, I still could not sleep properly at night. The nightmare of the quake was too fresh to\nforget.  In  Pune  we  were  staying  in  an  ordinary  hotel  but  the  staff  did  everything  possible  to  make\nthings comfortable for me. In fact, they overdid things on occasions and were themselves embarrassed\nas a result. To ensure we all had hot water, the maintenance person had switched on the boiler very\nearly  in  the  morning. As  a  result,  the  boiler  overheated  and  all  we  ended  up  with  was  black  muddy\nwater in the room. Being used to staying in five-star hotels, initially I was irritated with the hotel staff,\nbut  later  I  found  it  funny  that  they  were  trying  so  hard  to  make  me  comfortable.  The  effort  was\noverwhelming and left a lasting impression.\nSoon after the end of the Duleep Trophy game, in which I scored 199 in our only innings, a number\nof  journalists  asked  me  if  we  stood  a  chance  against Australia.  I  said  we  did  and  felt  confident  we\ncould  beat  them,  provided  we  were  able  to  put  them  under  pressure.  It  seemed  to  me  they  weren’t\naccustomed to handling pressure and it would be interesting to see how they reacted if we gained the\nupper hand.\nFirst Test, Mumbai, 27 February–1 March 2001\nThough  we  lost  the  first  Test  in  Mumbai  in  three  days,  we  did  have  our  moments  in  the  match.  I\nscored 76 in the first innings, getting out when I went for an expansive shot to a McGrath delivery that\nwas wide of off stump. In the Australian first innings we reduced them to 99–5, with Harbhajan Singh\ntaking  three  quick  wickets,  before  an  aggressive  counter-attacking  partnership  between  Hayden  and\nGilchrist  took  the  match  away  from  us  again.  We  dropped  a  few  catches  and  they  both  managed  to\nscore hundreds, giving Australia a sizeable first-innings lead.\nWe  started  the  second  innings  with  thirty  overs  remaining  in  the  second  day  and  had  lost  two\nwickets by the time we came to the last over. Then the nightwatchman Nayan Mongia was hit on the\nfinger by a ball from Gillespie and retired hurt. I had to go in and play out the last five balls, a task\nthat is never easy, particularly with Gillespie bowling at his best. The next morning I resumed with\nRahul Dravid, knowing it was going to be a stern test of our character. McGrath and Gillespie were\nbowling  in  tandem  and  while  Rahul  mostly  played  Gillespie,  I  played  out  a  very  good  spell  from\nMcGrath. We hardly rotated strike, knowing that once we had played out the initial burst from these\ntwo bowlers, things would become a lot easier.\nI scored a half-century but I think even my harshest critic would concede that I got out in a most\nunfortunate manner. I played a full-blooded pull shot to a short Mark Waugh delivery, which would\nhave  been  a  definite  boundary  had  the  ball  not  hit  Justin  Langer’s  back  at  forward  short  leg  and\nspooned  up  to  midwicket.  Ricky  Ponting  ran  fifteen  yards  and  dived  forward  for  a  very  good  catch.\nThe momentum had shifted and Australia soon capitalized on the advantage and closed out the game.\nThe Australians  had  now  won  sixteen  straight  Tests  and  needed  to  win  just  one  more  to  set  a  new\nworld record.\nSecond Test, Kolkata, 11–15 March 2001\nThe  Kolkata  Test  match  was  undoubtedly  one  of  the  best  I  played  in,  but  it  didn’t  start  well  for  us.\nAustralia  scored  445  in  the  first  innings,  thanks  to  110  from  Steve  Waugh  and  97  from  Matthew\nHayden,  and  when  we  were  at  a  dismal  128–8  at  the  end  of  day  two,  with  the Australian  quartet  of\nMcGrath,  Gillespie,  Kasprowicz  and  Warne  all  taking  wickets,  not  even  the  most  ardent  Indian  fan\nthought  we’d  be  able  to  save  the  match.  I  had  scored  ten  in  our  first  innings  and  everybody  was\ndejected after our frankly pathetic batting display. John Wright, our coach, was livid and took it out on\na few plastic bottles in the dressing room.\nThe poor performance hurt even more because it followed the high of the first ever Indian hat-trick\nin Test cricket. Harbhajan had picked up Ponting, Gilchrist and Warne in succession on the first day,\nswinging  the  match  in  our  favour  again  after Australia  had  reached  a  position  of  strength  at  252–4.\nBhajji was brilliant throughout the series and this was the very best I had ever seen him bowl. First he\nhad Ponting lbw, then he followed up with the wicket of Adam Gilchrist. Understandably there was a\nlot of talk among the players before the hat-trick ball and I had an urge to tell Bhajji what I thought he\nshould bowl to Warne, the new batsman. However, I decided not to and all I said was that he should\nbowl what he thought best. He ended up bowling a low full toss, which Warne played into the hands of\nforward short leg.\nAt the end of our first innings on the third morning at Eden Gardens, even though we failed to avoid\nthe follow-on, there were signs of better things for us when Laxman, batting at six, managed to add a\nfew  runs  with  the  tail.  He  scored  59  and  was  the  last  man  out.  There  was  a  brief  discussion  in  the\ndressing room and we all agreed that Laxman, who was obviously in good touch, should go in at three\nfor the second innings, with Rahul moving to six. None of us had any idea that this swap would result\nin history being written.\nLaxman and Rahul batted like champions in the second innings and I thoroughly enjoyed seeing an\nextraordinary batting effort unfold before my eyes. India scored 335 runs in the second innings on day\nfour without losing a single wicket. Not to lose a wicket in a day is unbelievable and to do it against\nthe  world’s  best  team  makes  the  achievement  all  the  more  miraculous.  Laxman  played  some\nunbelievable shots off Warne and both he and Rahul had to battle serious physical exhaustion in the\nintense heat and humidity, but they held on, eventually scoring 281 and 180 respectively, and by the\nend of the day we knew we couldn’t lose the Test match. In fact, we had started to believe that we had\na slim chance of winning if we bowled well on the last day. This in itself was a dramatic turnaround,\nbecause  for  the  first  time  in  the  series  we  had  managed  to  put Australia  under  pressure,  just  as  I’d\nhoped.\nWe declared early on day five with a lead of 383 and knew we had a chance if we could force the\nAustralians  back  with  a  few  quick  wickets.  Harbhajan  was  bowling  with  exceptional  skill,  but  we\nneeded someone to back him up from the other end. We did not get the wickets we were after in the\npost-lunch  session,  however,  and Australia  went  to  tea  with  just  three  down.  The  game  was  drifting\ntowards a draw unless something dramatic happened.\nWanting  to  try  something  different,  Sourav  decided  to  give  my  bowling  a  go.  He  hoped  that  a\ncouple of breakthroughs might open up the game and he knew that the large Kolkata crowd would get\nbehind us if they sensed an opportunity. I would always bowl for two or three overs when there were\npartnerships,  and  being  an  irregular  bowler,  I  had  licence  to  experiment.  On  the  fifth-day  pitch  I\ndecided to bowl leg-spin, pitching the ball in the rough with two left-handers at the crease. It was one\nof those rare days when the ball came out perfectly and I managed to take three quick wickets for the\nteam in a five-over spell, including the wickets of in-form Matthew Hayden and the dangerous Adam\nGilchrist.\nHowever, the wicket that gave me the most satisfaction was that of Shane Warne. I tried to bowl\nhim  a  googly  and  the  ball  ended  up  being  a  half-tracker,  landing  in  the  middle  of  the  pitch  before\nturning in to hit Warne plumb in front. Warne had perhaps misread the delivery and had first tried to\ncut before playing a half-pull. I had bamboozled one of the great spinners of all time!\nWe now had the opening we were after and Bhajji did the rest. When we finally took the last wicket\nof Glenn McGrath, with just three overs or so remaining in the match, the stadium went mad. Close to\n100,000 spectators at Eden Gardens could not believe we had managed to win – and it was only the\nthird time in history that a team had won after following on.\nWe celebrated for a long time after the match. The atmosphere in the changing room had changed\ncompletely after such an incredible win. There was a tremendous sense of positivity and we started to\nbelieve that we could go on to win the series. The Australians had collapsed in the face of sustained\npressure. The myth of invincibility had been shattered. The series was now locked at 1–1, with all to\nplay for in the third and final Test at Chennai.\nThe  impact  of  the  victory,  celebrated  all  across  the  country,  is  perhaps  illustrated  by  an  incident\ninvolving SK Bansal, one of the umpires officiating in the Test. Mr Bansal later recounted to me that\nhe had gone out for a meal after the match and his driver had mistakenly taken a wrong turn. He was\nheading the wrong way up a one-way street and was soon stopped by a traffic constable. Mr Bansal,\ndreading the consequences the driver would be subjected to, stepped out of the car to ask the constable\nto forgive the poor fellow. The constable, who turned out to be an ardent cricket fan, recognized Mr\nBansal and promptly decided to let the driver off.\nThird Test, Chennai, 18–22 March 2001\nThe  Australians  started  well,  with  Matthew  Hayden  once  again  leading  the  way.  He  had  batted\nwonderfully  throughout  the  series  and  was  the  only  Australian  batsman  who  looked  comfortable\nagainst  Harbhajan.  He  scored  an  impressive  double  hundred  and  the Australians  notched  up  a  first-\ninnings score of 391. I bowled a good spell on the first day, carrying on from Kolkata, and got the ball\nto turn sharply but did not take any wickets, but by the end of the spell, the skin of my fingers had\nstarted to peel off and I was finding it hard to grip the ball.\nAustralia, who were at 326–3 at the end of day one, suffered a collapse on day two, ending up with\njust 391. It all started with an unusual dismissal. Against skipper Steve Waugh we were trying to keep\nthings tight and when he tried taking a single to short cover I prevented the run and said a few things\nto him on the lines that he was trying to get away from the strike. Rahul, fielding at leg slip, offered a\nfew words and before long we were able to get under Waugh’s skin. Finally, when Harbhajan beat him\nwith a good off-spinner and appealed for lbw, Waugh, in a momentary lapse of concentration, moved\nthe ball away with his hand. We appealed for handling the ball, and the Australian captain was on his\nway back to the dressing room. Mission accomplished, we didn’t say another word to him.\nI was determined to make amends for my batting failures in Kolkata and had practised hard against\nreverse  swing  in  the  gap  between  the  two  Test  matches.  I  decided  to  follow  the  ball  throughout  my\ninnings and not to lose sight of it at any time. To play well against reverse swing you have to keep\nyour eye on the ball for as long as possible and that was what I did all day, as it was passed from the\nwicketkeeper to the slips and through the hands of various fielders back to the bowler. I focused on the\nball and nothing else. The only time I was not following the ball was when I was talking to the non-\nstriker about something. As the bowler came in to bowl I concentrated on the ball and monitored the\nrelease  as  closely  as  possible.  From  the  arm  position  and  the  release  point  I  could  assess  what  was\ncoming at me and I tried to play as late as possible.\nThis exercise was draining and by the end of the day I was mentally exhausted. However, I had done\nwhat the team needed me to do: I had scored a hundred. I had forged an important partnership with\nRahul, which was all the more satisfying because we had to negotiate a very hostile Jason Gillespie\nspell with the second new ball. Gillespie, who was tired after bowling all day, wasn’t bowling quite so\nfast with the second new ball, but suddenly he gained inspiration from an unlikely source. One solitary\nAustralian  fan,  sitting  at  the  top  of  the  sightscreen  and  carrying  a  huge  toy  kangaroo,  started\nscreaming after every delivery, urging Gillespie on. He was shouting ‘Come on Aussie’ each time he\nwalked  back  to  the  end  of  his  run-up.  The  fan  had  a  huge  impact  on  him.  Within  minutes  Gillespie\nstarted  to  bowl  really  quickly  again  and  was  all  fired  up.  Rahul  and  I  even  discussed  what  had\nhappened to him all of a sudden. It just goes to show that you don’t always need thousands of fans to\nmotivate you.\nOur partnership of 169 helped the team to an important 110-run lead, giving our bowlers some runs\nto play with in the second innings. The match was nicely poised in our favour and we knew we had a\nchance to close out the series. Hayden was once again going to be the crucial wicket. He fell for 35 to\nthe bowling of Nilesh Kulkarni. Gilchrist was the other danger man lower down the order, because we\nknew he could score quickly and put the pressure back on us. But Bhajji, who had a grip on Gilchrist\nand Ponting right through the series, once again took the bulk of the Australian wickets, finishing off\nwith a career-best haul of 8–84 in the innings. We needed 155 runs to win the series.\nThe chase started well and we were cruising before Mark Waugh pulled off an unbelievable catch at\nshort midwicket. It was a full-blooded pull shot from VVS Laxman and Waugh just flung himself at\nfull stretch to come up with a stunning catch. Laxman had been batting brilliantly for his 66 and his\ndismissal left us at 135–6, changing the course of the match yet again. Suddenly we had a contest on\nour hands.\nBy this stage, the whole team was sitting nervously outside the changing room. Everyone was told\nnot to change seating positions and we were all feeling the tension. There were not too many runs left\nto  get,  but  at  stake  was  a  series  win  against  the  world’s  best  cricket  team.  The  crowd  was  cheering\nevery Indian run. It could not get any bigger.\nAt a crucial time, Harbhajan Singh and Sameer Dighe, our wicketkeeper and my very close friend,\nput together a partnership that, though not a big one, was perhaps the most significant of the series.\nFighting unbelievable pressure, they somehow held things together to take us over the line and the rest\nof the team were in raptures. The way the two of them ran the winning runs was almost comical, but it\nwas  an  incredible  feeling  to  know  we  had  won  the  match  and  the  series.  We  were  all  shouting  with\ndelight and handing out high-fives and hugs. We had beaten the best team in the world and it felt truly\namazing  to  have  accomplished  what  I  had  predicted  before  the  start  of  the  contest.  We  had  put  the\nAustralians  under  pressure  and  had  reaped  the  rewards  for  doing  so.  The  whole  team  had  stuck\ntogether despite losing the first Test, and this series is without doubt one of the best I have played in\nmy career.\nComing at a critical time, the series also helped restore Indian fans’ faith in the game. Cricket had\nonce again triumphed over all odds. Both teams had played hard cricket and the passion and intensity\nwas at a high level throughout. Played before huge crowds, it was the best possible advertisement for\nTest  cricket.  To  Australia’s  credit,  they  were  always  competitive  and  had  actually  come  close  to\nwinning in Chennai themselves, picking up eight Indian wickets in the second innings.\nAs we celebrated the series win I remember being very pleased to see Anil, who had not played a\npart in the series because of injury. He had been present in the pre-series training camp and had come\nalong to cheer on the team during the third and deciding Test.\nDuring the ODI series that followed, which we lost 2–3, I reached 10,000 runs in ODIs, in the third\ngame in Indore, and in the last match in Goa I did something that I have never done again in my life. I\ninjured my index finger and ended up bowling off-spin with my middle finger for ten overs, picking\nup  3–35  in  the  spell,  including  the  wicket  of  Steve  Waugh.  The  moment  Waugh  came  in  to  bat  I\nstarted gesturing towards the midwicket fielder, suggesting to Waugh that I would get him out there. It\nwas friendly banter and Waugh retorted by saying I wasn’t playing in my garden. As luck would have\nit, Steve tried playing a slog sweep to midwicket and was caught there by Ajit Agarkar.\nAustralia in India 2001 – The Border-Gavaskar Trophy\n1st Test.

            "title": "STANDING UP FOR MYSELF\n",
            "data": "In July 2001, two months after the Australia series, we played a tri-series against the West Indies and\nZimbabwe at Harare. I had trained hard in the off season and felt in good shape ahead of the series.\nFor close to two years, between August 1999 and July 2001, I had been injury-free and the off-season\ntraining had definitely helped improve my fitness. I used to run in the mornings and do gym sessions\nin the afternoon to strengthen my upper body and I also kept a check on my diet. The discipline had\nhelped and the 1999 back injury was now just a bad memory.\nI started the tournament in red-hot form and scored two fifties and a century in the four pool games,\nbeing dismissed only once. But just as I had started to look forward to the final, I suffered the second\nmajor injury of my career in rather unexpected circumstances.\nIt happened during the last of our group matches against the West Indies on 4 July 2001. Rahul and\nI were batting together and we were cruising to victory. With some 20 runs left to win, I turned a ball\nto midwicket and set off for two runs. That’s when I heard something click in my big toe. Immediately\nI felt a sense of discomfort and found it difficult to complete the second run. Before the next ball I\nwalked up to Rahul and said that I had hurt my toe and that the temperature in my foot had suddenly\ngone up a few degrees. However, with so few runs needed, I decided to stay in and finish off the game\nas quickly as possible, making 122 in the process.\nAfter the match I showed the toe to Andrew Leipus, who had taken over as our physiotherapist, and\nthe next morning we went for an X-ray. The pain had actually increased in the interim and I was now\nstruggling to walk properly. On our way to the hospital I asked Andrew not to tell me about the results\nof the X-ray, for no matter what, I wanted to play in the final. Soon after the X-ray, Andrew, looking\nsomewhat helpless, just said to me, ‘You are a crazy man.’\nBefore  the  game  it  was  decided  that  Andrew  would  strap  the  toe  bent  down  to  prevent  any\nmovement and I took the field against the West Indies in considerable physical discomfort. I had been\nin terrific touch throughout the tournament and the thinking was that my batting was more important\nfor the team than my fielding and bowling. Personally, I felt I would be able to make it through the\ngame, as it happened to be the final match. After all that effort, however, I proceeded to get out for a\nduck and we lost the match. It turned out I had damaged my sesamoid bone, which is the bone at the\nconnection of the big toe and the first metatarsal.\nAfter returning to India I was prescribed total rest, but after two months I still wasn’t happy with\nthe  way  the  recovery  was  going.  I  could  barely  walk  without  discomfort.  In  desperation  I  saw  a\nspecialist,  who  advised  me  to  have  surgery.  We  even  fixed  a  tentative  date,  but  that’s  when Anjali\nadvised me to seek a second opinion. She felt that surgery should always be the last resort and we had\nto be sure there was no other way to get the injury treated.\nWe went to the Bombay hospital and saw one of the most senior doctors around, Dr Dholakia. He\nshowed me a big fat book on sesamoid bones and informed me that the author of the book, who was\nthe world expert on sesamoid injuries, wasn’t a hundred per cent certain that surgery was the best way\nto  treat  them.  He  went  on  to  say  that  I  shouldn’t  allow  anyone  to  touch  my  toe,  as  it  might  be\ncounterproductive. There was the possibility of permanent damage, which might bring my career to an\nend,  and  that  was  a  scary  thought.  On  the  very  same  day  Dr  Dholakia  started  looking  into  where  I\ncould go to get my toe examined by a specialist.\nEventually I found myself at the Rosebank Clinic in Johannesburg, where Dr Mark Ferguson, who\nhad worked with a lot of sportsmen, advised me to try out a few insoles. Over a week in South Africa I\nwent  from  walking  for  fifteen  minutes  to  close  to  an  hour.  Back  in  Mumbai  I  continued  with  the\nroutine, building up from jogging to running. Running in cricket shoes was a bit of a problem because\nof the spikes, so for the next few months I wore shoes with no spikes immediately under my toes. The\ninjury, it appeared, was finally on the mend.\nMy  first  tour  after  the  lay-off,  coincidentally  perhaps,  was  to  South Africa  in  October–November\n2001. We were playing a tri-series against South Africa and Kenya before going on to play a three-\nTest  series  against  the  South  Africans.  However,  in  our  very  first  tour  game  against  the  Nicky\nOppenheimer XI on 1 October, the pain in my toe resurfaced. It was a strange sensation and I left the\nfield to get some treatment.\nLuckily for me we were in Randjesfontein, which is not far from Johannesburg, so I set out for the\nRosebank Clinic again. Much to my relief, I was assured there that it wasn’t anything major and that a\nslight recurrence of pain was normal with sesamoid bone injuries. They told me that there was no need\nto panic. I left the clinic with a sigh of relief and was eager to get back to playing cricket again.\nThe first match of the tri-series was in Johannesburg on 5 October and I managed to score a hundred\nagainst South Africa. The intensity of the match pushed the thought of the injury out of my mind, but\nafterwards I was relieved that I’d been able to bat for so long with very little pain. It was as if I had\nstarted all over again.\nIndia in South Africa, November 2001\nTaking on South Africa in their home conditions is always challenging and it was even more so having\njust recovered from the toe injury. I had, however, started to feel more confident after a net session at\nBloemfontein,  the  venue  for  the  first  of  the  three  Tests.  I  distinctly  remember  that  session  because\nevery ball hit the middle of my bat and it seemed to me that I could do no wrong.\nThe first Test started on 3 November and happily my touch with the bat was still there in the first\ninnings. I made 155 out of a team total of 379, and it was the first time I played the upper cut over the\nslips, a shot I went on to use regularly in the second half of my career. I had come up with the idea of\nthe shot to counter the South African fast bowler Makhaya Ntini, whose strength was to bring the ball\nin to the batsman from short of a length. I knew that if I played the upper cut against Ntini, it would\naffect his rhythm, as he was not prepared for this form of counter-attack. The pitch in Bloemfontein\nhad a lot of bounce and in the absence of a third-man fielder the upper cut was a scoring stroke played\nwith minimal risk. I followed the ball till late and just helped it on the way over the slip fielders, using\nthe pace generated by Ntini.\nVirender  Sehwag,  on  his  debut,  also  played  aggressively  and,  had  we  batted  a  little  better  in  the\nsecond innings, we could have saved the game. Instead, we lost by nine wickets, with Shaun Pollock\ntaking 6–56. My partnership with Sehwag was our high point and I remember asking him if he was\nnervous when he walked out to bat for the first time in a Test. He admitted that he was a little and I\nimmediately told him that was normal. In fact, it was good to be a little nervous and everyone who\nplayed  Test  cricket  experienced  similar  nerves.  He  just  needed  to  play  his  natural  game  and  the\nnervousness would disappear once he’d spent a little time out in the middle. He did so and scored a\nfantastic hundred on debut.\nMissing the comforts of home\nWe went to Port Elizabeth for the second Test. Sara and Arjun were both with me and on one evening\nbefore the match I asked the hotel staff to recommend a restaurant where we could go out for a good\nfamily  meal.  Eating  together  was  the  only  way  I  could  spend  quality  time  with  my  children  and  I\nlooked forward to these meals at the end of long, hard work days. The hotel staff told me about a diner\nthat also had a fairly big play area where the children could enjoy themselves and we ended up going\nto the same restaurant three days in a row. It was from this restaurant that I picked up the idea of the\nplay area that I put in my own restaurant when I opened Tendulkar’s in Mumbai in 2004.\nFood  on  tour  was  always  an  important  consideration  for  the  team  and  to  get  the  kind  of  food  we\nliked in places such as Bulawayo in Zimbabwe and some South African cities could sometimes be a\nreal problem.\nI remember one occasion in Bulawayo when all the players were yearning for home food. We were\ntired  of  eating  the  same  breakfast  and  lunch  in  the  hotel,  and  the  restaurants  were  not  the  best.\nSpotting an Indian family that had come to see us play, Sameer Dighe boldly walked up to them and\nsaid that the team was desperate to eat some good Indian food – could they help?\nJhanak bhai, the man in question, was a Gujarati settled in Zimbabwe and he ended up inviting the\nteam to his home, where we feasted on a home-cooked meal of Gujarati-style dal, rice and ghee. We\nall had three spoons of ghee and pigged out on the food in front of us. It soon became a regular thing\nand Jhanak bhai and his family fed us many times. Others who have been kind enough to provide us\nwith  good  home-cooked  food  in  Zimbabwe  and  South Africa  are  Raj  and  Chester  Naik  and  Jayesh\nDesai. They have selflessly helped us whenever we have toured their parts of the world and have made\na  major  contribution  to  our  well-being.  Raj  and  Chester  Naik  also  took  us  to  play  golf  and  we had\nsome wonderful dinners together. Invariably Ravi Shastri would join us for these dinners because they\nwere his friends first. I became good friends with many of them and must say I will always remember\nthe warmth and affection I received from them and their families.\nUnacceptable allegations\nWe managed a better batting performance in the Port Elizabeth Test, which started on 16 November\n2001. Rahul Dravid and Deep Dasgupta, our wicketkeeper, played resolutely on the last day, and we\nsaved  the  match  comfortably  in  the  end.  However,  what  hit  the  headlines  from  that  match  were  the\nallegations made against me by the match referee Mike Denness, who also charged five other Indian\nplayers.\nThe  incident  occurred  on  the  third  day,  when  I  bowled  a  four-over  spell,  taking  the  wicket  of\nHerschelle  Gibbs.  I  was  bowling  seam-up  and  was  getting  the  ball  to  swing  both  ways.  During  this\nspell I used my thumb to clean off the grass that was stuck on the seam.\nSoon after the end of the day’s play we were informed that the match referee had called six Indian\nplayers  for  a  hearing  and  that  I  had  been  accused  of  ball  tampering.  I  was  shocked,  because  I  had\nalways played cricket with integrity and honesty and would never do such a thing.\nWhen I met the match referee I informed him that I was merely trying to clean the seam of the ball.\nMy mistake, which I have no hesitation in owning up to, was that I should have informed the on-field\numpires under Law 42.3 when I was cleaning the seam, but I’m afraid it did not enter my mind in the\nintensity  of  the  moment.  I  asked  Mike  Denness  to  consult  the  on-field  umpires,  because  they  had\nchecked  the  ball  every  two  or  three  overs  and  were  in  the  best  position  to  tell  if  the  ball  had  been\ntampered with. Denness said that there was no need to consult the umpires, presumably because I had\nadmitted altering the ball by cleaning the seam.\nI  found  this  strange,  because  there  was  no  way  Denness  could  gauge  what  was  going  on  in  the\nmiddle  when  he  was  sitting  eighty  yards  away  from  the  pitch.  None  of  the  umpires  had  lodged  a\nformal complaint against me and it was humiliating to be labelled a cheat. I wasn’t prepared to let it\npass. I informed Mike Denness that I would complain about the allegation to the BCCI and would not\nkeep quiet about it.\nApart from charging me with ball tampering, Mike Denness handed captain Sourav Ganguly a one-\nmatch suspended ban for failing to control the players and banned Virender Sehwag for one match on\na  charge  of  over-appealing.  Deep  Dasgupta,  Harbhajan  Singh  and  Shiv  Sunder  Das,  the  opening\nbatsman, were all handed a one-Test suspended ban and fined 75 per cent of their match fee for the\nsame  offence.  The  team  considered  these  punishments  harsh,  especially  when  none  of  the  South\nAfricans  had  been  pulled  up  despite,  we  felt,  appealing  just  as  aggressively.  It  is  a  hard  game  and\nsometimes things get heated in the middle. But we didn’t think we deserved the punishments we had\nbeen handed.\nWe  informed  the  BCCI  that  the  allegations  were  unsubstantiated  and  unfair.  We  were  delighted\nwhen the BCCI, led by Jagmohan Dalmiya, stood steadfastly behind us and informed the ICC that the\nteam had lost faith in the match referee. We also received support in the media; the Indian journalistic\nfraternity, at home and on tour, was united behind the team. We were prepared to abandon the tour if\nneed  be,  but  we  weren’t  ready  to  be  labelled  cheats.  It  was  about  honour  and  there  was  no  way  we\nwould allow a match referee to cast aspersions on our credibility.\nThings had come to such a pass at one point that we weren’t sure if the tour would actually carry on.\nThere were conflicting reports everywhere and the atmosphere was one of mistrust and confusion. The\nsituation came to a head twenty-four hours before the start of the third Test match, when it was finally\ndecided by the Indian and South African boards, rather than by the ICC, that Mike Denness should not\nofficiate in the match. Denis Lindsay, the former South African wicketkeeper, was the replacement,\nand the match went ahead, but it was labelled an unofficial Test match by the ICC.\nNot everything was right about it after all the acrimony, which I must say was largely unnecessary.\nMike Denness’s decisions had led to a crisis that had ended up dividing the cricket world down the\nmiddle. It was an avoidable incident and one that left everyone bitter in the end.\nIndia in South Africa 2001\n1st Test.

            "title": "A GLORIOUS ENGLISH SUMMER\n",
            "data": "Within  a  week  of  returning  from  South  Africa  we  faced  Nasser  Hussain’s  Englishmen  at  home  in\nDecember  2001.  Nasser,  nowadays  a  respected  commentator,  played  hard  and  came  up  with  some\nultra-defensive  tactics  against  me.  It  was  in  this  series  that  Nasser  instructed  his  left-arm  spinner\nAshley Giles to bowl from over the wicket and consistently pitch the ball way outside my leg stump.\nNasser and Giles were counting on the fact that I would have limited scoring options off balls bowled\nthere and were hoping to frustrate me and induce me to play a false shot. They had essentially given\nup any attempt to get me out in favour of trying to get under my skin.\nWhile Giles did manage to have me stumped, for the first time in my Test career, in the third Test\nin Bangalore, overall these tactics had little impact on the result of the series. I scored a lot of runs in\nall three Test matches and was declared Player of the Series.\nI was reminded of this series when Nasser, who is a good friend, met me a couple of years later in\nSouth Africa during the 2003 World Cup. We were in the washroom during the inaugural function and\nNasser  jokingly  started  the  conversation,  saying,  ‘So  I  am  in  the  washroom  with  the  great  Mr\nTendulkar.’ It was a minute-long conversation and we were both enjoying ourselves. It was friendly\nbanter between two people who have great regard for each other. From memory, the conversation went\nsomething like this:\nNASSER: You have to agree that I was successful in stopping you and getting you frustrated during\nthe 2001 England tour of India when I got Ashley Giles to bowl to you from over the wicket.\nSACHIN: You  did  indeed,  but  despite  his  efforts,  my  batting  average  for  the  series  was  76,  with\nscores of 88, 103 and 90 in the three Test matches, and I was in fact nominated Player of the Series. I\nwould love to have that average right through my career.\nWe won the series 1–0, a result that gave us considerable confidence as we looked forward to the\nreturn tour of England the following summer. It looked likely to be an enthralling series.\nSome thoughts on batting\nIt was in the early stages of the 2002 tour of England that I first gave a masterclass. It was at the Rose\nBowl,  where  we  were  playing  a  warm-up  game  against  Hampshire,  and  it  was  organized  by  Mark\nNicholas  for  Channel  4  television.  I  enjoyed  talking  to  a  group  of  youngsters  about  the  basics  of\nbatting, including how to grip the bat.\nPeople have often commented on my own grip, which is very low down on the handle. It all goes\nback to when I started playing cricket when I was eleven with my brother Ajit, who is ten years older.\nAs I didn’t have a bat of my own, I had to use Ajit’s full-size bat and the only way I could cope with\nthe weight at that age was to hold the bat right at the bottom of the handle. Some coaches suggested\nchanging my grip, and I did experiment, but it never felt right. I had got used to feeling the end of the\nhandle pressing against the inside of my forearm and if I gripped the bat further up I didn’t have that,\nand batting just didn’t feel natural.\nThat’s  not  to  say  that  my  technique  didn’t  change  at  all,  though.  Throughout  my  career,  I  was\nalways  looking  to  improve  and  constantly  tried  new  things  to  cope  with  different  situations.  My\nbacklift  changed  significantly  over  the  years,  for  example.  I  used  a  pretty  heavy  bat  and  I  was\nsometimes encouraged to move to a lighter one. Again, I did try but I never felt comfortable, as my\nwhole bat swing depended on that weight. When I was hitting a drive, I needed the weight to generate\nthe power. It was all to do with the timing. To me the bat should be an extension of your arm, and if\nyou’ve reached the stage where it’s become an extension of your arm, why do you need to change?\nWhat  mattered  to  me  most  when  I  was  batting  was  feeling  comfortable.  As  long  as  I  felt\ncomfortable, it didn’t matter where I was playing or who I was playing against. If you make technical\nadjustments,  such  as  moving  to  a  lighter  bat,  to  cope  with  different  conditions,  there’s  a  risk  of\nmaking yourself feel uncomfortable and of thinking too much about your technique. I’ve always felt\nthat I’ve batted best when my mind has been at the bowler’s end of the pitch, not at my end. In fact,\nfor both batsmen and bowlers, I’ve always believed that cricket is played best when your mind is at\nthe opposite end and that problems occur when your mind is stuck at your own end.\nFor example, if a bowler is thinking too much about bowling no-balls, he’s not going to be able to\nbowl what he wants to bowl. Instead, his mind should be at the batsman’s end, focusing on where he’s\ngoing  to  pitch  the  ball,  which  way  he’s  going  to  swing  it  and  so  on.  As  a  batsman,  if  I’m  not\nconsciously worrying about my footwork or my backlift or my wrist-work, then I know that I’m in the\nright space, because my mind needs to be at the opposite end, figuring out what the bowler is trying to\ndo. There’s no time to think about both ends at the same time. So in general it always seemed to me\nthat if I was comfortable with my gear, it would allow my mind to be at the opposite end and I had a\nbetter chance of playing well.\nIndia in England, the Test series, July–September 2002\nI have always enjoyed playing in England, but on the 2002 tour it took the team a little time to adjust\nto the conditions. The first of the four Tests, at Lord’s, started on 25 July 2002 and England won pretty\nconvincingly,  with  Hussain  making  his  highest  score  for  five  years  and  Michael  Vaughan  also\ncontributing a century. For India, the high point was my friend Ajit Agarkar’s second-innings hundred,\nand I was delighted to see his name go up on the famous honours board in the dressing room.\nWe knew we needed to be more competitive in the next Test at Trent Bridge ten days later if we\nwere  to  stay  alive  in  the  four-match  series.  Once  again  England  posted  a  huge  score,  with  Vaughan\nagain in good form, and we were faced with batting out the last day to survive. The pitch was assisting\nthe bowlers and quite a few balls were taking off from a good length, while some were keeping low. In\ndifficult circumstances, Rahul and I put together an important partnership. There were occasions when\nwe were beaten by balls which had either taken off or kept low and all we did was smile. We chatted at\nthe end of every over but never once talked about the deliveries we had missed. It was natural that the\nball  would  occasionally  beat  us  on  a  fifth-day  wicket  offering  uneven  bounce;  we  enjoyed  the\nchallenge.\nRahul got a hundred and both Sourav and I fell in the nineties. Sourav was out for 99 while I was\nbowled for 92 by part-time off-spinner Michael Vaughan to what was probably the best ball he ever\nbowled. The ball pitched in the rough outside my off stump and turned a long way to go through the\ngap between bat and pad to hit the stumps. That we managed to hold on for a draw, thanks to some\ndour resistance from wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel, a teenager at the time, was an important statement\nand it laid the foundation for the fightback at Headingley in the third Test.\nThere was a long gap between the second and third Tests, which allowed us to unwind and refocus.\nBy now we had come to terms with the conditions and were feeling more relaxed. We were enjoying\nourselves socially, going out to interesting restaurants to try out different types of food and spending a\nlot of time together, which is always essential in the middle of a difficult tour.\nIt  was  around  then  that  a  friend  of  mine  suggested  visiting  the  famous  Harry  Ramsden’s,  in\nGuiseley in West Yorkshire. This restaurant, I was told, served great fish and chips and Ajit Agarkar\nand  I  decided  to  try  out  the  fare.  There  was  one  item  on  the  menu  titled  Harry’s  Challenge,  which\ninvited the customer to eat a giant portion of fish, either cod or haddock, served with chips, bread and\nbutter and two other side dishes. If successful, the head chef would personally sign a certificate for the\ncustomer. I’ve always been a big eater, so I decided to take on the challenge. I must say I managed the\ngiant portion of fish fairly comfortably and also polished off the salad and other side dishes served to\nme.  The  only  thing  I  did  not  eat  was  the  chips,  which  I  thought  might  be  just  a  little  too  fattening.\nImpressed with my performance, the chef signed my Harry’s Challenge certificate all the same.\nThird Test, Headingley, 22–26 August 2002\nThe  wicket  was  very  damp  at  the  start  of  the  Headingley  Test  on  22 August  2002.  Despite  this,  we\ndecided to bat first after winning the toss. We were all in agreement that we should put runs on the\nboard  and  try  to  put  the  English  under  pressure.  Sehwag  got  out  early  but  then  Rahul  Dravid  and\nSanjay Bangar, our makeshift opener for the game, put together an excellent partnership of 170 that\nturned things our way. Batting wasn’t easy on a fresh wicket and they both played exceptionally well,\nleaving a lot of balls outside the off stump.\nI went in to bat in the last session of day one and decided to wear an inner-thigh guard. I had never\nused  one  before,  even  in  practice,  but  Andrew  Flintoff  was  getting  the  ball  to  jag  back  in  to  the\nbatsmen and I thought the inner-thigh guard might be a sensible protection against injury. However, I\nsoon realized that my stance had completely changed. Normally the forearm of my bottom hand rests\non  my  thigh  while  I  take  stance,  but  at  Headingley  it  felt  completely  different  because  of  the  new\nguard. I immediately decided to get rid of it and the experiment was never tried again.\nIn  this  innings  I  was  circumspect  to  start  with  and  decided  to  play  out  the  day,  waiting  for  my\nopportunity the next morning. Flintoff bowled a hostile spell and I really had to knuckle down. He was\ngetting  the  ball  to  swing  and  bounce  and  there  was  not  much  I  could  do  but  defend.  The  following\nmorning Matthew Hoggard, who had the ability to swing the ball both ways, also bowled impressively,\ngetting the ball to move away from the bat at good pace. Quality outswing is difficult to negotiate and\nI had to be watchful while playing big drives on the rise. Shot selection in this innings was the key.\nAndrew Flintoff produced another really probing spell. He was bowling into Sourav’s body and it\nwas decided that I would face up to him while Sourav, a left-hander, took as much strike as possible\nagainst Ashley Giles, who was once again bowling a defensive line to me outside my leg stump. When\nwe went back for tea to the dressing room, Sourav said, ‘Woh beech wale Flintoff ka spell humne kya\njhela  yaar. ’  (We  did  really  well  to  see  off  Flintoff’s  spell.)  I  couldn’t  resist  pulling  his  leg  and\njokingly said to him, ‘Humne jhela? Saala maine jhela hain!’  (Did we? I was the one who negotiated\nFlintoff!) The whole dressing room burst out laughing.\nIn  the  third  session  of  the  day  we  shifted  gears  and  launched  into  the  English  bowlers,  who  were\ngradually starting to tire. It was one of those rare matches in which we refused to take the light even\nwhen the umpires offered it to us. We were dominating proceedings and there was no reason to go off.\nIn the end the umpires came up to us and said that as they could not see the ball they were calling it\na day. I was unbeaten on 185 and we had a mammoth score on the board. We could not lose the Test\nmatch from that position and we already had enough runs for our bowlers to play with. By the time\nEngland’s  turn  came,  their  task  would  be  even  more  difficult,  because  the  wicket  was  becoming\nuneven and the odd ball had started to keep low. In fact, it was a low bounce that cost me my wicket\non the morning of the third day, when I was lbw to Andrew Caddick for 193. We finally declared our\nfirst innings at 628–8, one of our highest ever scores on English soil.\nThe  bowlers  took  over  and  from  the  start  of  the  English  innings  managed  to  put  them  under\npressure. Kumble and Harbhajan bowled beautifully in tandem in conditions that were not so helpful\nfor spinners and picked up three wickets each in the innings. There were no big partnerships and we\nkept  taking  wickets  at  regular  intervals,  finally  bowling  England  out  for  273  and  then  enforcing  the\nfollow-on. Our huge first-innings score had allowed us to put a lot of fielders in catching positions and\nwe attacked the whole time.\nIn  the  second  innings,  with  close  to  400  runs  in  the  bank,  we  kept  up  the  pressure  and  gave  each\nEnglish batsman a hard time. Even Nasser, who scored a hundred in the second innings, wasn’t spared\nand there was a lot of banter in the middle. We were all extremely motivated and did not want a single\nEnglish  batsman  to  settle  down  and  take  control.  Nobody  held  back  and  our  bowlers  made  regular\ninroads into the English batting. Each wicket was followed by a lot of talk and the new batsman was\ngiven a rousing welcome. When Andrew Flintoff got out for a pair, caught by Dravid at slip off Zaheer\nKhan, our left-arm fast bowler, we knew we were within striking distance of a famous victory. Anil\ndid the rest, picking up four wickets, and we bowled England out for 309, winning the match by an\ninnings and 46 runs.\nAt Trent Bridge in the previous Test we had played well to draw the match and now we had cashed\nin at Headingley. Kumble bowled his heart out for his seven wickets in difficult conditions and all the\nother  bowlers  –  Zaheer,  Ajit  Agarkar,  Sanjay  Bangar  and  Harbhajan  –  chipped  in  with  important\nwickets.\nFourth Test, The Oval, 5–9 September 2002\nWe followed up with another very good performance at The Oval. Rahul played a gem of an innings\nand his 217 allowed the rest of the batting to revolve around him. This match had special significance\nfor me because it was my 100th Test. I was nervous and excited on the morning of the game and the\nchief  executive  of  Surrey  County  Cricket  Club,  Paul  Sheldon,  presented  me  with  a  commemorative\nplaque. A special announcement was made and when it was my turn to bat people were expecting me\nto  carry  on  from  where  I  had  left  off  at  Headingley.  I  hit  some  good  shots  on  my  way  to  my  half-\ncentury, but then I unexpectedly got out to a ball I completely misread.\nI could see the ball in Caddick’s hand as he was about to start his run-up and it was clear that the\nshiny side was on his right side, or the on side. With normal swing, that would indicate an outswinger,\nso I said to myself here’s an opportunity for a big drive and I was ready to play the ball between mid\noff and cover. To my complete surprise, the ball came  in a long way and hit me on my heel. I have\nrarely been beaten so comprehensively and was out plumb lbw. The ball had reverse-swung and it was\nthe  first  and  only  ball  that  did  so  in  the  innings.  In  normal  circumstances  Caddick  didn’t  bowl  big\ninswingers, but got the ball to cut in to the batsmen. On this one occasion he somehow got the ball to\nreverse-swing a mile. It was particularly difficult to deal with because it was a Yorker-length delivery.\nIt was unusual for me to misread a bowler’s swing in that way, as I normally backed myself to work\nout  what  the  bowler  was  up  to  by  watching  the  ball  in  his  hand.  For  example,  every  time  Ben\nHilfenhaus, the Australian fast bowler, held an old ball cross-seam, I knew he would bowl a bouncer –\nand I would be prepared for it. This strategy came in handy during the India–Australia series in India\nin 2010, when I managed to score a double hundred in Bangalore. Similarly, I noticed that the Pakistan\nfast bowler Shoaib Akhtar would swing his bowling arm twice before he delivered his effort ball as he\ntried to generate more pace into the delivery. Again, I would be prepared for it.\nAs for spin bowlers, I have always monitored a bowler’s release point to work out what the bowler\nwas planning. In the case of the Sri Lankan legend Muttiah Muralitharan, he would have his thumb on\ntop of the ball when bowling a doosra. For his normal off-spin deliveries, he had his thumb below the\nball.  We  once  had  a  conversation  in  the  dressing  room  on  how  to  pick  Murali’s  doosra  and  I  told\neveryone  that  all  they  needed  to  do  was  watch  his  thumb.  One  day,  we  were  practising  at  the  SSC\nGround  in  Colombo  when  Murali  came  to  the  ground.  Bhajji  decided  to  go  up  and  ask  him  how  to\nbowl the doosra. Murali told Bhajji to use his thumb to support the ball from the top – that was the\nsecret. I had no idea about this conversation until Bhajji told me later. I felt very gratified that I had\nworked it out for myself.\nBeing able to spot the doosra helped me a lot, and not just when I was batting. When I did an over\nof  commentary  during  the  final  of  the  IPL  in  May  2013,  I  said  on  air  that  Bhajji  had  just  bowled  a\ndoosra to dismiss the South African fast bowler Chris Morris. Morris had played for conventional off-\nspin when the ball had actually gone the other way. The commentators, including Harsha Bhogle on\nair, said they were impressed because they had not been able to pick the doosra and the replay had not\nyet been shown.\nI should also say here that there were other occasions when I found it difficult to figure out what a\nbowler  was  planning  to  do.  One  bowler  I  found  particularly  challenging  in  this  respect  when  I  first\nfaced him was the New Zealand fast-medium bowler Dion Nash. His action was such that I thought he\nwould bowl inswingers at me, which he never did. I got out to Nash on the flattest of decks because I\nplayed for the inswinger when the ball was actually an outswinger. Eventually I worked him out, and\neven got a hundred against him in Wellington, but it did take me a while to do so.\nAnother bowler I had great difficulty picking at first was the West Indian left-arm fast bowler Pedro\nCollins. I had first seen Collins in a practice match during our May–June 2002 tour of the West Indies,\nwhen he bowled our opening batsman Wasim Jaffer with a big inswinger. I made a note that here was\na  bowler  who  started  with  inswing  early  on. Accordingly,  in  the  next  few  innings  I  played  for  this\ninswing, only to see the ball leaving me and I ended up nicking deliveries behind the wicket. I was out\nto  him  three  times  and  didn’t  last  more  than  two  or  three  balls  in  each  of  these  innings.  Midway\nthrough the series, I spoke with a number of West Indies players and I was told that actually Collins\nhardly ever bowled inswing – he normally got the ball to angle away from the right-hander. So by the\ntime of the final Test in Jamaica I was more confident against him and I managed to score 86.\nThe best bit about dealing with Collins, however, happened in India when the West Indies visited in\nNovember 2002. By then I had fully worked him out and had started to consciously watch the shine to\ntell which way the ball would be moving, because he was reverse-swinging the ball. If the shine was\non the outside I would even leave balls pitched on middle stump because I knew that by the time the\nball  passed  the  stumps  it  would  be  close  to  the  sixth  or  seventh  stump.  This  frustrated  Collins  and\nafter a while he realized my strategy and decided to go round the wicket. That’s when the mind games\nstarted. He did all he could to stop me seeing the shine of the ball. He ran in from right behind the\numpire so that he wasn’t in my line of vision. To counter this strategy, I deliberately pulled away once\nor twice and subsequently asked the umpire to crouch. I said I wasn’t able to see the bowler and did\nnot know when he was about to deliver the ball.\nThen I did something completely unorthodox. I decided not to take my stance when Collins was at\nthe top of his run. Instead, I moved to the off side so that I could see how Collins was holding the ball.\nI knew once he started running in he couldn’t change the grip and I had just enough time to come back\nand take my stance. It was actually hilarious: a batsman standing wide of off stump, craning his neck\nto  see  a  bowler’s  grip.  It’s  not  an  everyday  sight  in  international  cricket.  The  strategy  worked\nsurprisingly well and I more than made up for my bloopers against him in the West Indies earlier in\nthe year.\nNatWest Series, June–July 2002\nThe  Headingley  win,  which  helped  us  to  draw  the  Test  series,  followed  a  memorable  victory  in  the\nNatWest tri-series, making it a fabulous English summer for India. England, Sri Lanka and India were\nthe  three  teams  playing  for  honours  and  we  met  England  in  the  final  after  playing  each  other  three\ntimes  in  a  round-robin  format.  The  final  on  13  July  was  one  of  the  most  exciting  one-day\ninternationals of my career, and it is still fondly remembered by scores of Indian cricket fans.\nAll the way through the NatWest series I had been in good form, with two hundreds in the six pool\ngames.  We  had  successfully  chased  down  several  high  scores  and  we  weren’t  overawed  by  the\nEngland  total  at  Lord’s.  Rather,  we  were  silently  confident  of  reaching  the  steep  target  of  325.  We\nstarted the run chase well, with Sehwag and Sourav scoring freely and laying a brilliant foundation.\nHowever,  as  often  happens  in  cricket  when  you  are  chasing  a  big  total,  we  lost  a  number  of  quick\nwickets and slipped to 146–5 in no time. I was out bowled trying to cut a ball from Ashley Giles. By\nnow the mood in the dressing room had turned sombre and nobody was speaking – until Yuvraj Singh,\nthe  talented  left-handed  batsman,  and  Mohammad  Kaif,  a  right-handed  middle-order  batsman  and\nexcellent fielder, started an unlikely recovery act. They were scoring boundaries freely and at no point\ndid the asking rate go beyond manageable limits.\nOnce the partnership had started to blossom I had a feeling that something dramatic might happen. I\ncan’t explain why, but I was convinced it was not all over for us yet. The rest of the team sensed the\nopportunity  too  and  soon  each  run  was  cheered  in  the  dressing  room.  I  was  sitting  on  a  table  in  the\nmiddle of the room and was eating one energy bar after another. I was not particularly hungry but in\nthe  intensity  of  the  moment  kept  polishing  off  the  bars.  Before  long  the  atmosphere  had  changed\ndramatically  and  everyone  was  engrossed  in  the  game.  Cricketers  are  a  superstitious  lot  and  no  one\nwas allowed to shift position. If someone wanted to go to the toilet, he wasn’t allowed to do so in the\nmiddle of an over; he could only go at the end of an over and had to come back before the start of the\nnext.\nBy the fortieth over, Yuvraj and Kaif had got the measure of the English bowling and we realized\nwe had a real chance of winning the title. The next few batsmen were all charged up and even when\nYuvraj got out for 69 there was no dip in intensity. Kaif was still out there and we knew that the target\nwas within reach. Finally, when Zaheer and Kaif ran the winning runs in the last over of the match, the\ndressing room leaped in delight. We could not stop smiling and hugging each other – and Sourav did\nthe unthinkable of taking off his shirt and waving it above his head as he stood bare-chested on the\nLord’s balcony. It is an iconic image now but for some reason Sourav is always much too embarrassed\nto talk about it whenever I ask him!\nWe stayed in the dressing room for hours, picking over the finer points of the victory. We’d heard\nthat the England team had ordered champagne by the middle of our innings and had put a number of\nbottles on ice. With India at 146–5, an English win was deemed a mere formality. I don’t know if this\nstory is true, but a number of our players suggested to the England team at the end of the game that it\nwas time to pass the champagne over to us. We would be happy to take care of it. A number of bottles\ndid make their way to our dressing room and we finished them off before we left Lord’s.\nThere  were  Indian  supporters  everywhere  and  the  stretch  from  the  WG  Grace  Gate  to  St  John’s\nWood Tube station was packed with fans waving the tricolour and celebrating. The traffic had come to\na  standstill,  with  people  playing  music  on  the  road  and  enjoying  the  moment.  The  police  were\nextremely patient and realized it was a special occasion. A large crowd had waited for us to leave and\nwere all waving at the team bus and taking pictures as we finally left Lord’s with the trophy. It was a\nday few of us would forget.\nThe victory, which had seen youngsters like Yuvraj and Kaif come to the fore, suggested that the\ncore of India’s team for the 2003 World Cup was gradually coming together. It also proved that we\nhad  a  side  capable  of  doing  well  in  overseas  conditions.  In  Zaheer  Khan,  Ashish  Nehra,  Javagal\nSrinath, Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh we had a more than competent bowling line-up, and with\nSehwag, Sourav, Rahul, Yuvraj, Kaif and myself, we were capable of out-batting any opposition. Now\nit was important to sustain the momentum and peak at the right time to have a crack at the world title\nthat had eluded us for so long.\nEngland in India 2001\n1st Test.

            "title": "WORLD CUP 2003\n",
            "data": "India’s preparation for the 2003 World Cup in South Africa and Zimbabwe really started during the\ntour to New Zealand in December 2002. We lost to the Kiwis in both formats of the game and while\nthose  defeats  were  demoralizing,  as  defeats  always  are,  they  helped  the  team  to  focus  with  just  a\nmonth to go before the World Cup.\nWe played two Test matches in New Zealand and lost both. In the first Test at Wellington, which\nstarted on 12 December, we were beaten by ten wickets, with the match finishing in just three days.\nThe pitch offered a lot of assistance to the fast bowlers and even Parthiv Patel, our wicketkeeper, was\ngetting the ball to swing prodigiously in the nets.\nI played the first Test with an injured finger, which I had hurt during practice. On the first morning,\nwhen the rest of the team were on the ground preparing to play, I was in hospital with Andrew Leipus\ngetting my finger checked. The pain was getting severe and I was finding it impossible to catch the\nball. Even when a fielder gently tossed the ball to me to pass on to the bowler I was having difficulty\ncatching it. Batting was not so much of a problem, as I could grip the bat as normal, but fielding was a\nreal issue. I asked the doctor to numb my finger, but he refused, saying I would have no idea where my\nfinger was and might break it if I didn’t catch the ball properly. All I could do was put up with the\npain.\nWhen I got back to the ground, I went up to captain Sourav Ganguly and suggested I should field at\nshort leg. In that position, the ball would either lob to me or, if it was a firm hit, I would receive the\nblow  on  my  body  instead  of  attempting  to  catch  it.  Both  of  these  possibilities  were  fine  by  me. At\nshort leg no one expects you to stop a full-blooded shot with your hands. It was one of the few times I\nstood in that position in the second half of my career.\nAlthough the second Test match at Hamilton the following week was a low-scoring game, in the end\nit  turned  out  to  be  a  competitive  one.  On  reaching  Hamilton,  we  were  shocked  to  see  the  track  had\nbeen watered so much that the pitch was incredibly damp two days before the Test match. Then a lot\nof rain fell and the covers couldn’t be removed to allow it to dry properly. John Wright, our coach,\ntried inserting a key into the pitch the day before the match and the whole key went in without any\neffort. It was anything but a good Test wicket.\nThe dampness delayed the start by four hours on the first day, despite it being bright and sunny in\nHamilton.  The  umpires  did  the  right  thing  by  waiting,  as  there  was  no  way  Test  cricket  could  be\nplayed in such conditions. The crowd was getting restless but there was nothing the umpires or players\ncould  do.  When  the  match  finally  started  we  lost  the  toss  and  were  sent  in  to  bat  first  in  nigh-on\nimpossible batting conditions. We were bowled out for 99, with no one managing to get in.\nI was sitting next to John Wright when Harbhajan was going out to bat, with India six wickets down.\nJohn, a New Zealander, had tried telling us that we needed to stay at the wicket and that batting was\nexpected to become easier with time. I told John not to say anything to Harbhajan about digging in.\nFar  better  that  he  should  just  go  out  and  swing  his  bat.  Time  wasn’t  a  factor,  as  the  match  was  not\nlikely  to  last  the  full  five  days  anyway,  and  whatever  runs  he  managed  to  score  would  be  valuable.\nHarbhajan went on to make a quick 20, all in boundaries, and got out trying to defend the ninth ball he\nfaced.  His  innings  gave  John  a  good  laugh  amidst  all  the  disappointment  of  the  low  score.  While\nBhajji  had  scored  20  in  no  time,  all  the  batsmen  who  had  tried  to  stick  around  struggled  to  reach\ndouble figures.\nNew Zealand didn’t do any better; in fact, we managed to get a first-innings lead of five runs, which\njust  goes  to  show  the  nature  of  the  wicket.  In  the  second  innings  Rahul  and  I  had  a  pretty  good\npartnership  but  neither  of  us  managed  to  kick  on  for  a  big  score. After  the  partnership  was  broken,\nwickets fell in a heap and we finally set New Zealand a target of 160.\nI must mention the unique feat of Ashish Nehra in this game. He was the first man to bat twice and\nbowl in two innings on the same day in Test cricket. We had scored 92–8 by the end of the first day’s\nplay  and Ashish  was  one  of  the  not-out  batsmen.  He  resumed  his  innings  on  the  second  day  but  we\nwere soon all out for 99. He was then part of our attack as we bowled New Zealand out for 94 in their\nfirst innings, before we ourselves were bowled out in our second innings for 154. Finally, when New\nZealand came out to bat in the fourth innings of the match, Ashish had another bowl at them in the\nfinal moments of the day.\nWe  discussed  his  feat  in  the  dressing  room  and  wondered  if  anything  of  the  sort  had  happened\nbefore. A total of twenty-two wickets had fallen in a day and there wasn’t much that the batsmen on\neither side could do in such conditions. It was disappointing for the crowd, who had come to watch a\nfive-day game. Their only consolation was that the match was very close in the end and the home team\nwon by four wickets.\nFighting for fitness\nWith both Test matches over early, I decided to spend a lot of time in the gym working on my fitness\nahead of the World Cup. Sehwag was my training partner and we used to award marks. We worked on\nspecific body parts each day and rated each other for the effort put in. We even joked that we were\nperhaps  scoring  more  marks  in  the  gym  than  the  total  runs  we  had  scored  in  the  series.  But  both\nSehwag and I were confident that the effort put in would pay off sooner or later.\nAfter the Test series was wrapped up we played a seven-match one-day series, losing 2–5. Again,\nmost of the wickets weren’t really suitable for international cricket. I did not feature in the first four\nmatches because of an ankle injury, which I sustained in practice on the eve of the first one-dayer at\nAuckland. It was one of the few freakish injuries I have had in my career. I had just finished bowling a\nlong spell to each of our batsmen when Srinath called out, ‘Last ball, with four runs to win.’ I picked\nup the ball again to bowl one final delivery at him. I had not noticed a big hole in the corner of the\npractice pitch and, unluckily for me, as I ran to stop Srinath’s shot, my foot landed in the hole and I\nslumped to the ground in agony. After a frustrating couple of weeks, I eventually made a comeback in\nthe fifth match of the series, at Wellington, and was promptly out for a duck. In fact I scored just one\nrun  in  each  of  the  next  two  matches  and Anjali  and  I  joked  about  my  scores  –  which  read  0,  1,  1  –\nbeing the dialling code for an Indian city!\nThe New Zealand experience was best summed up by the home captain Stephen Fleming. At the end\nof the tour Fleming stated that the tour had done enough to breed a sense of false complacency among\nthe bowlers, while the batsmen were now worrying about flaws in technique that weren’t really there.\nThe conditions were simply not good enough for international cricket and the series was not the best\nadvertisement for the game.\nWarming up\nThere was no doubt I was not in the best physical shape when the team left for the World Cup in South\nAfrica and Zimbabwe in February 2003. I was recovering from three injuries: the finger, the ankle and\na strained hamstring. As a result, at our training camp in Paarl, in the Western Cape, I was not able to\nrun with the team and spent my time cycling to keep up my cardio exercises. It was frustrating, but I\nknew I had to push myself to get back to fitness before the first match of the tournament against the\nNetherlands on 12 February.\nThe injury that bothered me most was the ankle. It had not fully healed and I had to strap it before\nevery practice session and match. Strapping the ankle all the time became an ordeal and it started to\nfrustrate me. So much so that one day I was careless when removing the strapping after training and\nsuddenly felt a strange sensation in my hand. I was holding the strapping, which had a thick layer of\nmy skin on it, which had come out of my heel. The skin was stuck to the tape and I ended up putting it\nback because otherwise there would have to be a hole in a sensitive area of the foot. I know it sounds\ngruesome,  but  there  was  little  else  I  could  do  in  the  circumstances.  After  that  it  was  particularly\npainful when I had to go into the sea with the rest of the team as part of our recovery routine and the\nsalty water would really sting. The incident at least taught me to be more careful about handling my\ninjuries, however frustrating they might be.\nWe played two practice games, both against the KwaZulu-Natal side. While we batted reasonably in\nthe first game on 4 February in Pietermaritzburg, with Yuvi and Dravid both doing well, the game on\n6  February  at  Chatsworth  didn’t  go  according  to  plan.  We  managed  to  get  the  opposition  out  fairly\ncheaply, and I remember Sourav saying that, because we needed as much batting practice as possible,\nthe opposition should bowl the full quota of fifty overs to us, even if we’d achieved the target. In fact,\ntowards the end of the Natal innings we were all trying to give them some extra runs and Sourav kept\nclose-in fielders in the ring to allow them to score freely, so that we would have a decent total to chase\ndown.  But  in  our  reply  we  collapsed  well  before  the  fifty  overs  and  the  question  of  the  opposition\nbowling the full quota never arose! We were all out for 158 and lost the match by 32 runs.\nIn both matches I had batted at number three, which was the result of a decision that had been taken\nsoon after we had reached South Africa. There had been a meeting of the senior players and the coach,\nand most of my team-mates, including Sourav, Rahul and Srinath, felt I should bat at number three in\nthe competition. Only Anil suggested that I should open. The majority argument was that at the top of\nthe  order  I  might  get  a  good  ball  early  on  and  get  out,  which  would  end  up  putting  the  team  under\npressure. After the second practice game John Wright came to my room and asked me if I was really\nhappy batting in the number three position. I assured him that I would bat anywhere the team wanted\nme to. John, however, insisted that I should voice my personal opinion as a player, so I said that, if it\nwere up to me, I would prefer to open. I went on to say that I felt I could control the game from that\nposition, and I also told him that there was no guarantee anyway that I wouldn’t get out early if I was\nbatting at number three or four, as it only takes one good ball. So I thought my best opportunity to set\nup the match for India was as an opener. John agreed with me and finally convinced Sourav and the\nrest of the team that having me at the top of the order was our best option.\nThe pool games\nThe less-than-impressive performances in our warm-up matches had made the first pool match on 12\nFebruary 2003, against the Netherlands, extremely important. We had to start well to give ourselves a\nfighting chance in the tournament. Even if the Netherlands were not the best opposition in the world,\nthey  had  some  good  players  in  their  team  who  had  experience  of  playing  on  the  county  circuit  in\nEngland. As I went out to bat, I was unusually nervous. The expectations in India were huge and the\ndressing  room  was  also  expecting  a  lot  from  me,  now  that  they’d  agreed  to  my  wish  to  open  the\nbatting. I’d caused our plans to be changed completely and now it was up to me to deliver.\nI was deliberately conservative in my approach at the start and set out to build a solid foundation\nbefore we went on the attack. We had been getting out for scores of 150 and less and it was important\nthat we batted the full fifty overs and posted a reasonable total. I managed to score a half-century and,\nwith Mongia contributing 42 runs down the order, we just passed the 200-run mark, making 204 all\nout.  It  wasn’t  a  score  to  rave  about  and  we  knew  that  with  one  good  innings  from  a  Netherlands\nbatsman we might have a contest on our hands. At the team meeting before the start of their innings\nwe agreed that we should play as if we had to bowl the opposition out for 150, to force us to apply\nourselves  properly.  Eventually,  it  was  Srinath  and  Kumble,  with  four  wickets  each,  who  helped  us\nachieve that aim as we bowled them out for 136. We had not played our best but had still managed to\nwin.\nOur next match was against defending champions Australia at Centurion on 15 February. They were\nplaying excellent cricket and were firm favourites to win the tournament again. We played a very bad\ngame from the start and lost a heap of early wickets. I scored 36 and we were bowled out for a very\npoor 125 and lost the game by nine wickets.\nOur underwhelming performances in South Africa so far were not going down well with supporters\nat  home  and  we  heard  that  some  irate  fans  had  vented  their  fury  that  evening  by  throwing  tar  at\nMohammad Kaif’s home in Uttar Pradesh. It was alarming to read about the hostile reaction in India\nand I eventually had to issue a formal appeal, in the form of a media release, to try to pacify the fans. I\nstated that we were all trying our best and there was no dearth of commitment at our end. This had\nsome effect and we were able to concentrate once again on the task at hand.\nStopping the rot\nIn 2003 Zimbabwe were a very good side in home conditions, and included some very talented players\nin their ranks. It was only after 2004–5, when the country was laid low by political turmoil, that many\nof these players stopped playing for Zimbabwe. In our pool game against them in Harare we played\nwell from the start and won by 83 runs in the end. We could sense that we were getting back into form\nand it was surprising how one good win could boost a team’s confidence. I scored 81 off ninety-one\nballs  and  Bhajji  picked  up  the  crucial  wicket  of Andy  Flower,  Zimbabwe’s  best  batsman.  Now  we\nneeded to carry this form forward, as we would soon be playing England in what was likely to be a\ncrucial match for us, one that could guarantee a place in the Super Six.\nBefore the England match, however, we had to play Namibia on 23 February and it was important\nnot  to  take  it  easy  against  a  relatively  weak  team.  We  kept  the  pressure  up  and  scored  311–2,  with\nSourav and me both scoring hundreds. Our bowlers then dismissed the opposition for 130, with Yuvraj\nSingh  taking  four  wickets  for  six  runs,  and  though  not  much  could  be  read  into  our  performance\nagainst a team like Namibia, it was apparent that things were moving in the right direction.\nThe build-up to the England game at Durban on 26 February was something else. England versus\nIndia is always a big game, but this time it was the World Cup and it was a must-win game for both\nteams. Apparently Andrew Caddick said a number of things before the game and our players who read\nthose statements were fired up on the eve of the match. I had not read them and to this day don’t know\nexactly what was said. I had scored runs in all three matches so far and was simply looking forward to\nanother opportunity.\nWe won a very important toss and decided to bat first. Batting under lights at Durban is always a\nchallenge and winning the toss had given us the early advantage. Our plan was not to give away early\nwickets,  even  if  we  didn’t  score  quickly.  Once  the  first  five  or  six  overs  had  gone  by  we  started\nshifting gear and looking for runs, passing 50 in no time. Durban always offers something for the fast\nbowlers and I knew that Caddick and the other tall England bowlers would look to exploit the extra\nbounce by bowling short of a length. I was ready for the short ball and it finally came in the ninth over\nof the innings when Caddick bowled one a foot and a half outside the off stump. It was exactly what I\nwas waiting for and I swivelled back and hit him over midwicket for six. The moment the ball hit my\nbat I knew it was going the distance.\nIn his next over I played one of my favourite shots of the World Cup. I was hoping Caddick would\nover-compensate and bowl a fuller delivery, which he did. It wasn’t a bad ball but I managed to play\nan  off  drive  on  the  up,  bisecting  mid  off  and  the  bowler  for  four.  The  timing  and  impact  felt\nwonderful. I hit two more boundaries in the same over and we raced to 75 off just eleven overs.\nIt  was  a  dream  start  in  a  very  big  game  and  it  took  a  great  spell  from Andrew  Flintoff  to  bring\nEngland  back  into  the  match.  He  conceded  just  15  off  his  ten  overs  and  picked  up  two  wickets.  He\ncaught and bowled Sehwag for 23 and then had me caught by Collingwood at point for 50. It was an\nextraordinary spell that undid our good start. At this point Yuvraj was getting increasingly restless in\nthe dressing room and I remember saying to him that it had to be his day. It was now his responsibility\nto finish the innings off with a flourish and make sure that we did not squander the early advantage.\nYuvraj and Rahul went on to bat beautifully to take us to 250 at the end of our innings, but we still felt\nwe were 20 runs short.\nThe  England  innings  started  well  for  us  with  an  incredible  piece  of  fielding  by  Mohammad  Kaif.\nNick Knight, the left-handed opening batsman, had played the ball off the back foot and was running a\nquick single when Kaif swooped in from cover to pick up the ball and dived full-length to break the\nwicket. England were 6–1 and we had an early breakthrough. It was an excellent piece of athleticism\nfrom one of our best fielders.\nWe picked up Marcus Trescothick, the other opener, when he mistimed a pull off Zaheer and ended\nup giving me an easy catch at backward square. It was then that Ashish Nehra took over. It was easily\nthe best I have seen Ashish bowl and he looked a man possessed that night in Durban. He was getting\nthe ball to move both ways and was bowling at speeds between 140 and 145 kph, making it extremely\ndifficult for the England batsmen to negotiate his pace and swing. It must be one of the best spells of\nfast bowling by an Indian bowler in a limited-over international. By the thirtieth over England were\neight  wickets  down  with  more  than  140  runs  still  required.  Rahul,  who  was  keeping  wicket  in  that\ntournament, and Sehwag took some good catches off Ashish’s bowling and the whole team was fired\nup. We could sense we were knocking on the door of the Super Six stage.\nIndia eventually won the match by 82 runs. It was now a question of sustaining the momentum for\nthe rest of the tournament. This time there were great celebrations back home and India were suddenly\nthe  team  to  beat  in  the  competition.  While  Durban  had  set  us  on  course,  our  next  match  against\nPakistan was just massive. It was one of the most high-pressure cricket matches I have played in and\nhad enormous significance for our fans back home. Without doubt it was the match of the World Cup.\nBattlefield Centurion\nThe first time I heard people talking about the India–Pakistan fixture at Centurion Park on 1 March\n2003  was  exactly  a  year  earlier,  when  some  of  my  friends  had  been  discussing  it  with  great\nexcitement. It was always going to be a huge game for both teams. The intensity was such that I could\nnot sleep properly for three nights before the game. If there was ever a match we wanted to win, it was\nthis one. The nation would brook no failure and for many of our fans this was the true final. It really\ndid not matter to them what happened in the rest of the tournament, as long as we managed to beat\nPakistan at Centurion.\nThe  ground  was  buzzing  hours  before  the  match.  It  was  sport  at  its  best.  This  is  why  I  played\ncricket, to be out in the middle for my team, on the world’s biggest cricketing stage, against India’s\narch rival. Listening to the national anthem and singing the words gave me goose bumps.\nPakistan batted first after winning the toss and put together a very good score. Saeed Anwar held the\ninnings together and made a very important hundred for his team. Their total of 273 was at least 20\nruns more than we wanted to chase. As we were walking off the pitch, Sourav asked me if we should\nhold a brief team meeting. I said there was no need. Everybody knew what to do and it was now time\nto go out there and do the job.\nDuring the break I hardly spoke to anyone at all. Nor did I eat much. In fact, for most of the time I\nhad my headphones on and listened to music, trying to work myself into the right frame of mind. I just\nhad a big bowl of ice cream and a banana to give myself some energy and asked one of the players to\nlet  me  know  as  soon  as  the  umpires  had  walked  out  to  the  middle.  When  they  were  in  position,  I\npicked up my bat and went out to start the run chase.\nGenerally it was Sehwag who took first strike, but this was a day with a difference. On the way out I\ntold  him  that  I  would  take  strike  and  said  that  we  needed  to  play  out  the  initial  burst  from  the\nPakistani fast bowlers before we started attacking. Needless to say, Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis and\nShoaib Akhtar were capable of doing a lot of early damage.\nThat’s not how it turned out, however. In the very first over of our innings, I drove Wasim to the\ncover  boundary.  Then  I  took  a  single  off  the  next  ball  and  Sehwag  scored  a  boundary  off  the  final\ndelivery. Shoaib Akhtar bowled the second over and in many ways it turned out to be the defining over\nof the match. His first ball to me was a wide. The next ball I played watchfully. I scored a single off\nthe third ball and then he bowled another wide to Sehwag, which also allowed us to go through for a\nsingle. It was his sixth ball that allowed me to go after him. It was short and wide. I sighted the ball\nearly and within a fraction of a second had made up my mind to go over third man. It wasn’t exactly\nthe upper cut but more of a hard slash over the third-man fielder that sailed over the boundary. Trying\nto  compensate  for  the  short  ball,  Shoaib  bowled  the  next  one  on  a  length  on  the  off  stump  and  I\nshuffled across and flicked him behind square for four.\nIt  was  a  dream  start.  We  had  shed  our  initial  inhibition  and  had  started  to  attack.  Having  already\nscored 10 off his last two balls, I was intent on playing the final ball of the over cautiously, so I just\npunched it back towards mid on. It was a defensive stroke, but the timing was such that it sped across\nthe turf to the long-on boundary. We had scored 18 off the over.\nPakistan  were  obviously  feeling  the  pressure  when  Waqar  came  on  to  bowl  in  the  fourth  over,\ngiving Shoaib a break after one disastrous over. Sehwag launched Waqar’s first ball for six over third\nman and we attacked him straight away. We were now egging each other on and were speaking to each\nother loudly in Hindi, which the Pakistanis could understand, of course. Our body language had turned\naggressive and when I finished off the Waqar over with another four we were firmly in control. We\nhad not allowed the bowlers to settle down and had seized the advantage. It was the best early assault\nagainst Pakistan that I had been involved in and it could not have come at a more important time. We\nreached 50 in just five overs and the target of 273 was no longer the huge mountain it had seemed at\nthe start of our innings.\nAs with most India–Pakistan matches, however, there had to be a shift in momentum and against\nthe run of play Pakistan picked up two wickets in Waqar’s next over – first Sehwag and then Sourav\nwith  the  very  next  ball.  Pakistan  were  back  in  the  match.  Mohammad  Kaif  came  in  next  and  it  was\nimportant for us to put together a partnership and also not to get bogged down. Kaif played well and\nran hard between the wickets to make sure I had as much of the strike as possible. The run rate had not\ndipped and I reached my fifty with a scoring rate of over 150 for the innings.\nThis  innings  must  rank  as  one  of  the  best  I  have  played  because  of  the  immense  pressure  it  was\nplayed under. Each boundary brought me an ovation from the raucous crowd. Wearing the tricolour on\nmy  helmet  on  sport’s  biggest  stage  against  the  nation’s  premier  opposition  while  being  watched  by\nclose to a billion fans – what more could I have asked for? I just had to bat Pakistan out of the game.\nIt was in my seventies that I started cramping up. I received some treatment but refused to have a\nrunner as I have always been uncomfortable with someone else running for me. My concentration was\naffected and much as I would have liked to power on, it wasn’t possible. I eventually got out to a short\nball from Shoaib Akhtar for 98. In that physical state I found it difficult to get up on my toes to keep\nthe rising ball down. I walked back to a standing ovation.\nImportantly,  we  still  had  a  deficit  of  96  runs  and  my  innings  would  have  little  value  if  we  lost  a\ncouple of quick wickets. There was no need to fear, as Rahul and Yuvraj took control and finished the\nmatch  with  almost  five  overs  to  spare.  They  both  made  half-centuries  and  India  had  won  a  famous\ncontest, continuing our run of success against Pakistan in World Cups.\nI felt very proud when I went out to receive the Man of the Match award, a watch. It was one for all\nour passionate fans back home. I called a number of my friends in India and was told that the country\nhad erupted in celebrations. We were glad we could give our people such a moment to cherish.\nNobody wanted to call a halt to the celebrations in the dressing room, until finally the team decided\nto go out for something to eat, as we were all starving. It was close to midnight and we ended up going\nto a roadside stall for Chinese food. My friends Sunil Harshe and Sanjay Narang, there to cheer on the\nIndian team, also came along, and it was over our dinner of noodles that I decided to give Sanjay my\nMan of the Match watch to take back to Mumbai.\nSome  time  later,  after  we  had  finished  dinner  and  were  on  our  way  back  to  the  hotel,  Sanjay\npanicked.  He  told  me  that  he  had  left  the  watch  at  the  Chinese  food  stall. At  first  I  thought  he  was\njoking, but he wasn’t and he said he would never joke about something as precious as a World Cup\nMan  of  the  Match  award.  He  immediately  called  the  stall  and  told  them  he  had  left  his Adidas  bag\nbehind, saying that it contained his shoes rather than a gold watch. Then we rushed back and, to our\nenormous relief, an elderly lady handed over the bag with a smile.\nThe road to the final\nOur  next  three  matches  were  against  Kenya,  Sri  Lanka  and  New  Zealand  and  we  won  them  all\nconvincingly.  India  were  playing  fantastic  cricket  and  we  had  started  to  believe  that  we  could  give\nAustralia  a  run  if  we  made  the  final.  Here  I  am  a  bit  embarrassed  to  reveal  a  very  personal  secret\nrelating  to  the  Sri  Lanka  match.  On  the  eve  of  the  match  I  had  a  bad  stomach  and  was  feeling\ndehydrated. This happened because I had not yet fully recovered from the cramp I had suffered while\nplaying Pakistan and as a result had had a lot of isotonic drinks. I also added a teaspoon of salt to the\nenergy  drinks,  thinking  it  would  help  the  recovery,  and  that  caused  a  tummy  upset.  In  fact,  the\nsituation was so bad that I had to bat with tissues inside my underwear. I even had to go back to the\ndressing room during one of the drinks breaks and was feeling extremely uncomfortable in the middle.\nI somehow scored 97, but batting with stomach cramps wasn’t a pleasant experience. I was pushing\nmyself to the limits of endurance and in the end I was glad that the effort paid off.\nIndia  were  now  in  the  semi-final  and  we  were  drawn  to  play  Kenya,  who  had  caused  a  stir  by\nbeating a few of the top-ranked teams. In fact, during the match between Kenya and Sri Lanka, which\nwe  watched  in  the  games  room  in  our  hotel,  a  rather  odd  thing  happened.  Every  time  we  said\nsomething good about a Sri Lankan player, the player got out. It was strange and in no time Kenya had\ncaused a huge upset.\nWe  played  our  semi-final  against  Kenya  at  Durban  and  managed  to  win  the  match  comfortably.\nSourav and I had a very good partnership and the team managed 270 in our fifty overs before bowling\nthe  Kenyans  out  for  179.  We  were  in  the  World  Cup  final,  with  eight  straight  wins  behind  us.  The\ndefeat to Australia in the qualifying rounds seemed a lifetime away. Now we were playing them in the\nfinal and we were convinced we had the team to stop them from winning back-to-back world titles.\nSo near and yet so far\nUp till then, all of the players in the team had only watched others take part in a World Cup final. Now\nit was our turn. The excitement back home was extraordinary and a huge number of people had come\nto South Africa to cheer on the team. We had peaked at the right time and were playing some really\ngood  cricket.  Naturally  we  were  all  determined  to  give  our  best  in  the  final  but  perhaps  we  got\nourselves too wound up. The evening before the final the team decided to spend some time in the pool.\nTo  our  surprise,  the  water  was  freezing  but  that  did  not  stop  us  from  jumping  in  together.  I  didn’t\nsleep well that night.\nWhen  we  got  to  the  ground  the  next  morning,  we  immediately  went  over  to  take  a  look  at  the\nsurface. It was apparent to us all that there was moisture in the pitch and, given it was a day game, the\nfast bowlers were sure to get some early assistance. It would not be a bad idea to field first if we won\nthe toss. That’s what we did, but the decision turned out to be a disaster, with Ricky Ponting playing\none of the best one-day innings of all time, making 140. Australia scored a mammoth 359 in their fifty\novers and had almost batted us out of the game.\nIn  hindsight,  I  would  still  have  opted  to  field.  It  was  because  we  could  not  keep  a  lid  on  our\nexcitement that we lost the plot early on. Zaheer conceded 15 runs in the first over and though we still\nfelt we could make a comeback after that one bad over, it just didn’t happen. Towards the concluding\nstages of their innings, every big shot that Ponting played made our task that much more difficult. In a\nfinal, every run scored after the total passes 300 is worth double and 358 was an intimidating target\nagainst a fantastic Australian bowling attack. In the team discussion at the interval we reckoned that\nwe needed to hit one boundary every over and then score the remaining 160 runs in 250 balls. It was\nan attempt to be positive, as there was no other option left to us at that point.\nI  took  first  strike  again  and  managed  to  score  a  four  with  a  mistimed  pull  off  McGrath.  When  I\nattempted  a  second  pull  shot  I  got  a  top  edge  and  felt  utterly  dejected  to  see  McGrath  settle  down\nunder  the  ball  to  take  the  catch.  In  situations  like  those  you  can  only  pray  that  the  ball  falls  in  no\nman’s land or that the fielder makes a mistake. It was not to be and I was on my way to the pavilion.\nWhile walking back, I kept asking myself why on earth I had played that shot. Maybe I should have\ngiven  myself  two  or  three  overs  to  settle  down,  but  the  pressure  of  the  chase  was  such  that  attack\nseemed the only option.\nIn  the  middle  of  the  innings  there  was  some  light  drizzle  and  it  turned  really  dark.  My  thoughts\nwent back to the South Africa series in January 1997 when rain had denied us victory. This time I was\npraying for rain and hoping that the match would be washed out, forcing a re-match the next day. We\nwere not so lucky and were eventually all out for 234.\nAt  the  presentation  it  was  difficult  to  watch  the  Australians  celebrate  while  our  own  camp  was\nfeeling the pain of defeat. When my name was called to collect the Man of the Tournament award for\nthe 673 runs I had scored, it didn’t give me much excitement. I am not suggesting that I did not feel\nhonoured  or  proud,  but  the  feeling  was  overshadowed  by  the  loss.  Now  we  would  have  to  wait  four\nyears before we could have another crack at the World Cup.\nIn my disappointment, I had not even noticed that the bat I was presented with as the Man of the\nTournament was made of gold and I just stuffed it in my kitbag and checked it in as luggage on the\nway back. Only when people asked to see the bat after we landed in Mumbai did I realize it was gold\nand had been specially crafted. All I did on the flight back was sleep. Most of the players were still\nupset and were in no mood to talk. It would take a long time to get over the disappointment.\nLooking  back,  the  2003  World  Cup  remains  a  bitter-sweet  memory.  We  played  some  excellent\ncricket  as  a  team  and  I  contributed  well  in  almost  all  of  the  matches  –  but  not  in  the  final.  Beating\nEngland and Pakistan were unforgettable high points, but the World Cup trophy was still eluding me.\nIndia in the 2003 World Cup\n7th match.

            "data": "As  soon  as  the  World  Cup  was  over  I  consulted  a  series  of  specialists  and  was  advised  to  have  an\noperation on the ring finger of my left hand because of calcification. There was no other option and in\nApril 2003 I travelled to Baltimore, USA, with my family to get the surgery done. Dr Anant Joshi, as\non  many  occasions  in  the  past,  was  with  me,  and  his  reassuring  presence,  together  with  that  of  my\nfriends Vini Desai and Paresh Bhakta, was always a great source of strength in moments like these.\nThe surgical process turned out to be slightly out of the ordinary because I was not the best patient.\nI  was  extremely  worried  that  the  doctors  would  cut  open  my  palm.  Cutting  the  palm  would  mean\nsubstantially altering my grip, which I really didn’t want to do. I explained to both my surgeons the\nnuances of cricket and urged them to cut open the back of the hand. I was so obsessed with this issue\nthat I woke up during the surgery and asked them to show me where they had made the incision. Dr\nJoshi later told me that they were all surprised to see me awake despite the anaesthesia. The doctors\nshowed me that my palm had been left untouched and told me to calm down and allow them to carry\non. Satisfied, I instantly drifted back to sleep.\nThe surgery kept me off the field for close to four months. There was not much cricket scheduled\nthen and I missed only one tour, of Bangladesh, in the period I was out. The recovery was painful and,\nas often happens, I jarred the hand on a number of occasions during the period of convalescence. The\none time I hurt it really badly was when I was holidaying in London in June 2003. Anjali and I went\nout for dinner and then took a taxi back to the hotel. While paying the taxi driver my finger got stuck\nin  the  glass  of  the  window  and  I  fell  to  the  ground  in  severe  pain.  The  taxi  driver  was  alarmed  but\nAnjali  assured  him  that  it  was  not  his  fault  and  told  him  to  carry  on. After  a  few  painful  minutes  I\nfinally managed to walk back to the hotel.\nIndia in Australia, November 2003–February 2004\nSo  far,  2003  had  turned  out  to  be  a  good  year  for  Indian  cricket.  Making  the  World  Cup  final  was\nsomething to be proud of, but there were still plenty of challenges ahead. We were due to play a Test\nseries against the world champions in Australia at the end of the year and that tour was to be followed\nby one to Pakistan in early 2004.\nBefore  leaving  for  Australia  we  played  a  one-day  tri-series  at  home  against  Australia  and  New\nZealand in October and November 2003. I was in good form and scored a couple of hundreds on the\nway to the final. Though we lost to Australia at Eden Gardens, I came away from it feeling confident\nof doing well in front of big Australian crowds.\nUnfortunately  my  series  Down  Under  started  in  the  worst  possible  fashion  at  the  Gabba  on  4\nDecember 2003. I lasted just three balls and was given out lbw to Jason Gillespie when the ball struck\nthe top flap of my pad. I thought it would have gone over the stumps by six inches or more and I was\ndisappointed to see the umpire raise his finger. Sourav and VVS Laxman managed to steady the ship,\nand Sourav, captaining India for the first time in Australia, duly played one of his finest Test innings.\nHis 144 at Brisbane helped to set the tone for the series. At the end of the day’s play he was ecstatic\nand had every reason to be so.\nThe  first  Test  was  drawn  and  we  moved  to  Adelaide  for  the  second  Test  on  12  December.  The\nAdelaide wicket was good for batting and the Australians made the most of their opportunity. When\nthey  scored  400  runs  on  the  first  day,  I  clearly  remember  the  Australian  team  standing  up  on  the\ndressing-room balcony and cheering the batsmen off the field. Day two started better for us and, with\nAnil bowling beautifully, we managed to restrict Australia to 556 in their first innings. With the good\nbatting conditions and a lot of time still left in the match, there was every chance we could make a\ncontest of it if we batted well enough.\nRahul  was  outstanding  and  his  double  hundred  helped  us  get  close  to  the Australian  first-innings\ntotal.  Laxman  too  was  majestic  and  it  reminded  us  of  the  incredible  partnership  Rahul  and  Laxman\nhad put together at Eden Gardens in March 2001, only this time the roles were reversed, with Rahul\ngetting a double hundred and Laxman a hundred. I lasted just six balls before I was caught by Gilchrist\noff the fast bowler Andy Bichel. It was an annoyingly soft dismissal.\nThe Australian second innings belonged to Ajit Agarkar, my team-mate from Mumbai. He produced\nhis best ever spell to set up the match for us. He took six Australian wickets for just 41 runs as we\nbowled the Australians out for 196, leaving us with 230 to chase. We fielded brilliantly in this innings\nand took some amazing catches, Aakash Chopra’s catch of Ponting at point off Ajit being the stand-\nout. I chipped in with two crucial wickets, bowling leg-spin. Steve Waugh and Damien Martyn had put\ntogether a good partnership and it was immensely satisfying to be able to get both of them out caught\nin the slips. It was time for the batsmen to close out the game.\nRahul  was  yet  again  the  star  performer  and  I  managed  to  contribute  37  before  falling  lbw  to  leg-\nspinner Stuart MacGill. We had put together a 70-run partnership at a critical time in the match, which\nwas particularly satisfying. Rahul hit the winning runs for us, remaining unbeaten on 72, and the team\nwas  thrilled  to  have  taken  a  1–0  lead  in  the  series.  We  stayed  in  the  dressing  room  till  late  and\nthoroughly savoured the moment. Never in our history had we managed a 1–0 lead against Australia in\nAustralia. We had matched the Australians in every aspect of the game and had a very good chance of\nwinning  the  series  if  we  continued  to  play  at  our  best.  Rahul  and  Laxman  were  in  imperious  form;\nSehwag  and  Sourav  had  made  important  contributions  in  both  Tests;  Aakash  Chopra,  our  second\nopener, had done a good job of blunting the new ball.\nOn the eve of the next game – the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne – I decided to take Anjali, Sara\nand  Arjun  out  onto  the  ground,  just  to  give  them  a  feel  of  what  it  is  like  to  be  inside  a  stadium.\nStanding in the middle of the MCG, they could imagine for themselves what we go through with more\nthan 80,000 people in the stands. It was Arjun’s first visit to a stadium.\nWe batted first after winning the toss on 26 December and Virender Sehwag played what must be\none  of  the  best  Test  innings  ever  seen  at  the  MCG.  He  was  in  his  attacking  mode  and  played  some\nstrokes that only he can play. I have no doubt that Sehwag at the top of the order was one of the best\nthings to happen to Indian cricket and he played a key role in leading us to the top of the world Test\nrankings in 2009. He really should have got a double hundred at the MCG, but was out for 195 hitting\na Stuart MacGill full toss to long on.\nThe rest of the batsmen unfortunately failed to capitalize on the start Sehwag and Aakash Chopra\nhad given us and we were all out for 366, allowing Australia back into the game. I faced only one ball,\ngetting a faint tickle down the leg side to Gilchrist, who was standing way back to Brett Lee. I turned\naround to see the ball travelling to Gilchrist and knew that it was the end of me. That is one of the\nworst  ways  of  getting  out  and  I  felt  embarrassed.  I  felt  even  worse  when  I  was  told  that Anjali  had\ncome to the MCG to watch after being persuaded by some of the other wives. I heard that she left the\nground the moment I was out and walked all the way back to the hotel. I couldn’t help reflecting on\nthe occasionally cruel and unpredictable nature of our much-loved game.\nAustralia responded impressively, playing brilliantly in their first innings and, with Ponting scoring\n257  and  Hayden  136,  effectively  batted  us  out  of  the  game  with  their  558  total.  Close  to  200  runs\nbehind, we would have to bat exceptionally well to save the match. We did not, and the series was 1–1\nwith one Test to play.\nOnce again, I did not make the contribution I had hoped for in the second innings at the MCG. To\nchange things a bit, I asked Sourav what he thought about batting ahead of me. It was towards the end\nof the third day’s play and Sourav, who was in good form, agreed to step up, allowing me the cushion\nof going in to bat the following morning at number five. The ploy seemed to work and all was going\nwell until I got out for 44, caught by Gilchrist off the fast bowler Brad Williams. I had been in control\nuntil I played one false shot, the feature of my batting in the series. It seemed that every time I tried to\nmove up a gear, I lost my wicket.\nIt all comes down to Sydney\nOn the eve of the fourth and final Test match in Sydney at the beginning of January 2004, John Wright\ncame to my room to try to get me to think positively and boost my confidence, which was a great help.\nI  had  also  had  a  long  conversation  with Ajit,  and  one  challenge  he  put  in  front  of  me  was  to  try  to\nremain not out in both innings. He said that I was allowing myself to get out to bowlers, rather than\nmaking them have to take my wicket, and that if I decided to rein myself in, no bowler would be able\nto get me out. I took up the challenge and decided to play a waiting game. Even if I looked ugly in the\nmiddle I was intent on sticking to my plan. Having got out twice in the series playing aggressive shots,\nI was simply not going to try anything extravagant at the SCG. True to my promise, I played what was\nin  some  ways  one  of  my  most  difficult  Test  innings.  I  consciously  checked  my  shots  and  was\ndetermined  not  to  get  out.  In  more  than  ten  hours  at  the  crease  I  did  not  play  a  single  cover  drive.\nWhen  the Australian  bowlers  cracked  a  few  jokes  at  my  expense,  I  remained  focused.  It  was  a  real\ntest.  Even  when  balls  were  there  for  the  drive,  I  let  them  go.  It  was  all  totally  against  my  natural\ninstincts and it left me drained but immensely satisfied. At the end of our first innings, I was not out\non 241 and had taken the team score past 700.\nWhen  I  think  about  this  Test,  I  can’t  help  remembering  that  for  some  reason  I  turned  unusually\nsuperstitious.  Anjali,  her  parents,  Sara  and  Arjun  were  with  me  on  the  eve  of  the  match  and  we\ndecided to go to a Malaysian restaurant for dinner. The food was excellent and we ended up ordering\nnoodles, chicken and a host of other dishes. My family then left for India the next morning, but I had a\nvery  good  first  day  and  was  unbeaten  on  73.  In  the  evening  I  decided  to  stick  to  the  routine  of  the\nprevious night and went to the same Malaysian restaurant, this time with Ajit Agarkar and a couple of\nother  players.  Not  only  did  we  sit  at  the  same  table,  but  I  had  exactly  the  same  food.  The  next  day\nwent  even  better  and  I  was  not  out  on  220.  That  night,  I  again  went  to  the  same  restaurant  and\noccupied  the  same  table  and  ate  the  same  food.  On  the  third  day  of  the  match,  with  the  Test  match\ngoing really well for us, we went to the same restaurant one final time. The restaurant manager must\nhave  thought  we  were  mad. At  the  same  time  he  must  have  been  elated  at  the  thought  that  we  had\nreturned because of the food. Little did he know the real reason for our fourth consecutive visit!\nAfter  my  double  century,  I  was  sent  to  address  the  media. A  local  journalist  said  that  I  had  been\ngetting a lot of flak in the press recently but, now that I had scored an unbeaten double hundred, would\nI  be  reading  the  papers  the  following  morning? All  I  said  to  him  was  that  I  had  not  read  anything\nduring  the  series  –  which  was  my  way  of  keeping  myself  insulated  from  all  the  hype  –  and  I  was\nunaware  of  what  they  had  written  about  me.  I  didn’t  have  a  problem  with  getting  flak  if  I  had  not\nperformed.  The  media  needed  to  do  its  job,  after  all.  But  I  was  not  looking  forward  to  reading  the\npapers just because I had scored some runs – I did not need validation from the media. Criticism and\npraise are two sides of the same coin and, having played international cricket for fifteen years, I had\nlearnt to take these things in my stride.\nWe backed up the first-innings batting performance with a very good bowling effort and dismissed\nAustralia for 474, with Anil taking a remarkable 8–141. We were ahead by 231 and now we needed\nquick runs to give our bowlers time to close out the match. Yet again we batted well and Rahul and I\nwere in the middle of a good partnership when Sourav sent two or three messages out to check when\nwe should declare. Rahul was the vice captain of the team and I said to him that it was his decision as\nmuch as Sourav’s. I was ready to go off whenever they wanted. Rahul was keen to bat on for a little\nlonger and we finally declared just after he was hit on the head by a Brett Lee bouncer when he was on\n91 and I was on 60 not out. In hindsight I must say we delayed the declaration too long. The ball was\nturning and bouncing, and we should have given Anil and the bowlers a few more overs on the fourth\nevening than the four they eventually bowled.\nSet  443  to  win,  Australia  were  under  pressure  throughout  their  second  innings.  Anil  bowled  a\nmarathon spell of forty-two overs, picking up four more wickets on the fifth day. In his final innings\nin Test cricket Steve Waugh played well to save his team some blushes. He was eventually out for 80,\ncaught by me at deep square leg off Anil. The crowd was desperate for a final Steve Waugh hundred\nbut it didn’t work out that way. Straight after taking the catch, I ran over to Steve and congratulated\nhim  on  a  fantastic  career  and  wished  him  all  the  best  for  his  future  endeavours  as  he  received  a\nstanding ovation from the Sydney crowd.\nAustralia held on for a draw and the series finally ended 1–1. Personally, it had been a great Test\nmatch for me and I was satisfied at having kept my promise to Ajit not to get out in both innings. It\nhad been extremely difficult to go against my natural instincts. But it was a series we really should\nhave won. We were the better team for most of it and had played exceptional cricket in patches. Had\nthe declaration on the fourth evening come a little earlier, and had we grabbed more of the chances\nthat  came  our  way,  we  might  have  made  history.  Despite  missing  out  on  a  series  win,  we  still  had\nreason to be happy and were looking forward to the tour of Pakistan that was just round the corner.\nIndia in Pakistan, March–April 2004\nThere was a lot of excitement about our tour to Pakistan. Playing Pakistan is always a big occasion for\nan Indian cricketer, and this was the first time we had played them in Pakistan since my debut series\nin 1989. The tour also seemed to have come at the best possible time for India; we had done well in\nthe series Down Under and most of the players were in good form.\nAs soon as we landed in Pakistan we realized just how different this tour would be. Unlike the first\ntime, when I was just sixteen, in 2004 I understood the full significance of an India–Pakistan series.\nThe security was simply unbelievable. We were whisked through immigration and on our way to the\nhotel we had a security vehicle ahead of the team bus. There were also bikes escorting the bus and we\neven  had  a  chopper  flying  above  us.  In  the  hotel  we  were  received  warmly  and  given  instructions\nabout the security protocols we were expected to follow. We were informed that the first room on our\nfloor was to be occupied by security personnel, who would check every visitor who came to the floor.\nThe floors above and below us had been sealed off. I had not experienced security like that before and\nit  was  a  very  strange  feeling,  because  we  were  just  sportsmen  who  had  come  to  Pakistan  to  play\ncricket.\nLeaving  the  hotel  wasn’t  an  option  and  this  meant  the  players  spent  a  lot  of  time  in  each  other’s\nrooms having dinner, playing cards and watching movies. It was always fun to be able to spend time\ntogether and the spirit of the team was excellent as we prepared for the first one-day international in\nKarachi on 13 March 2004.\nIt was the best possible start to the series, with the match decided on the very last ball. After we had\nscored  349  batting  first,  Pakistan  responded  well  but  came  up  short,  with  344  in  their  fifty  overs.\nUnfortunately, we lost the next two matches, but we did well to come back with victories in the final\ntwo games, winning the series 3–2. The final match was a thriller and we beat Pakistan by 40 runs in\nthe end. I have fond memories of this match, having taken a very good catch to dismiss the Pakistan\ncaptain  Inzamam-ul-Haq.  In  this  series  Inzamam  would  invariably  try  and  hit  the  slow  bowlers\nstraight back over the bowler’s head, so before the fifth ODI Murali Kartik and I made a plan for him.\nWe  agreed  that  I  would  stand  far  straighter  than  normal  at  long  on  and  would  be  ready  to  move\ntowards the sightscreen the moment Inzamam was on strike. Sure enough, he hit Kartik straight back\nover his head and I was ready for the opportunity. I caught the ball above my head just inches from the\nboundary rope and then sprinted towards my team-mates in the middle, knowing we had managed to\nprise  out  the  most  important  Pakistan  wicket.  In  the  end  it  was  a  terrific  result  and  it  gave  us\ntremendous confidence ahead of the first Test at Multan.\nFirst Test, Multan, 28 March–1 April 2004\nAt  Multan,  Virender  Sehwag  played  a  blinder.  We  won  the  toss  and  from  the  word  go  he  was  in\ncontrol.  He  played  some  outstanding  shots  and  his  innings  had  the  effect  of  demoralizing  the\nopposition on the very first day of the series. He flayed the Pakistani bowlers to all parts of the ground\nand by the time I joined him in the middle he was already well past his century.\nI remember that just after tea Sehwag seemed to lose concentration. He began trying to hit every\nball and looked a bit agitated. I walked up to him to calm him down and told him that he just needed\nto  hang  in  there  and  let  this  spell  pass.  I  also  said  to  him  that  he  should  check  himself  a  bit,  as\nsomething big was about to happen. It was important to grab this opportunity and not let it slip away. I\nwas glad to see him grind it out on his way to a double hundred. As soon as he reached the milestone,\nhe  was  back  in  his  groove  and  the  shots  started  to  flow  again.  I  was  even  more  delighted  when  he\nmanaged  to  get  to  a  triple  hundred  on  the  second  morning.  It  was  an  incredible  effort  and  coming\nagainst Pakistan made it all the more special.\nBy the time Sehwag reached that landmark, I had made a century. I had paced my innings nicely\nand we were now firmly in the driver’s seat. At teatime I asked stand-in skipper Rahul Dravid, who\nwas in charge because Sourav was out with a back injury, and coach John Wright what the plan was. I\nwas  informed  that  we  were  looking  to  give  Pakistan  an  hour  to  bat  and  so  would  put  them  in  with\nfifteen overs left on the second day.\nIt was perfectly sensible and I went about my business after tea with this plan in mind. In fact, I was\npacing my innings so that I could reach my double hundred and we could still give Pakistan fifteen\novers to bat, as was the plan. But then, a little more than half an hour into the post-tea session, Ramesh\nPowar, who was substituting in the game, came onto the field and asked me to accelerate. I even joked\nwith him, saying I was aware that we needed quick runs but with the field totally spread out, there was\nonly so much we could do.\nA little later, when I was on 194, he came out again and said that I should try and get to my double\nhundred  in  that  over  itself  because  Rahul  had  decided  to  declare.  I  was  startled,  to  say  the  least,\nbecause  in  my  mind  I  still  had  twelve  balls  in  which  to  score  the  remaining  six  runs  before  fifteen\novers were left for the day. However, as it happened, I did not get to play a single ball in that over,\nwith Yuvraj on strike against Imran Farhat, Pakistan’s opening batsman and part-time leg-spinner. He\nblocked  the  first  two  balls  before  picking  up  two  runs  off  the  third  ball.  He  once  again  blocked  the\nfourth ball and was out to the fifth ball. Then, just as Parthiv Patel, the next batsman, started to come\nout, I saw Rahul gesturing us to go back to the pavilion. He had declared the innings with me stranded\non 194 and with sixteen overs still left for the day, one more than we had agreed at tea. I was shocked,\nas  it  did  not  make  any  sense.  It  was  day  two  of  the  Test  match  and  not  day  four,  as  it  had  been  in\nSydney a month earlier.\nDisappointed and upset, I made my way back to the dressing room and could sense that the whole\nteam was surprised at the decision. Some of my team-mates perhaps expected me to throw my gear\nabout  in  the  dressing  room  in  disgust  and  create  a  scene.  However,  such  things  are  not  in  me  and  I\ndecided not to say a word to anyone about the incident. I calmly put my batting gear away and asked\nJohn Wright for a little time before I went out to field because I was feeling a little tight after batting\nfor so long. Inside I was fuming.\nJust as I was washing my face in the bathroom, John walked up to me and apologized. He was sorry\nabout what had happened and said he had not been party to the decision. I was surprised and said to\nhim that as coach he was one of the decision-makers and there was no reason for him to be sorry if he\nbelieved in what had been done. I also said that what was done could not be reversed and it was best to\nleave  it  alone.  Finally,  I  couldn’t  help  reminding  him  that  the  declaration  was  contrary  to  what  had\nbeen discussed at tea and it was strange that I was not given even one ball to get to my double hundred\nafter a message had been sent out asking me to get there as quickly as possible.\nSoon after my exchange with John, Sourav came up to me and said he was very sorry at what had\nhappened and that it wasn’t his decision to declare. This was a little surprising because Sourav, as the\nskipper, was part of the teatime discussion and was also present in the dressing room at the time of the\ndeclaration. I said to him there was no point going over it any more.\nAt the end of the day’s play I was asked by the press if I was disappointed by the declaration and I\nhad no reason to shy away from the truth. Soon after the press conference I put my headphones on and\nlistened to music all the way back to the hotel. Then I hit the gym to work out my frustration. Some of\nthe Pakistan players were also in the gym but none of them spoke to me, sensing the state of mind I\nwas in. I worked myself hard, trying to get the declaration out of my mind, then headed up to my room\nfor some time alone.\nIn the evening Professor Ratnakar Shetty, our manager, came to my room for a chat. I had known\nProfessor Shetty since I was a youngster in Mumbai. He apologized for what had happened and said he\ndid not agree with the declaration. However, it was a cricketing decision and he did not ever interfere\nwith  cricketing  decisions  as  manager.  I  assured  him  that  it  was  over  and  done  with  and  would  not\naffect my contribution to the team.\nIt  was  when  I  was  talking  to  Professor  Shetty  that  Sanjay  Manjrekar,  who  was  in  Pakistan  as  a\ncommentator, turned up in my room. Sanjay said that it had been a brave decision to declare and that\nit was a good sign for Indian cricket. He carried on in that vein until I asked him if he really knew\nwhat  he  was  talking  about.  I  explained  to  him  that  he  was  not  aware  of  what  had  transpired  in  the\ndressing room and had arrived at his judgement without knowing the real facts of the matter. I made it\nclear that I did not appreciate his opinion, which I thought was a deliberate attempt to be different.\nThe following morning, Rahul finally came to me and said he had heard that I was upset and wanted\nto  have  a  chat.  I  informed  him  that  I  was  indeed  upset  and  there  was  no  way  I  would  pretend\notherwise. I asked him what the thinking was behind declaring at the time that he did. It wasn’t as if\nwe were pressing for a win, and one over wouldn’t have made much difference. We had agreed to a\nplan at tea and I was doing exactly as I had been told.\nRahul  said  that  the  call  was  taken  with  the  interests  of  the  team  in  mind.  It  was  important  to\ndemonstrate to the Pakistanis that we meant business and were keen to win. I wasn’t convinced. First,\nI said to him that I was batting for the team as well. Yes, I had scored 194, but the 194 was meant to\nhelp the team and it was my individual contribution to the team’s cause. So to say that the decision\nwas taken in the best interests of the team wasn’t altogether correct.\nI reminded him of what had happened in Sydney less than a month earlier, when we had both been\nbatting on the fourth evening and Sourav had sent out two or three messages asking when we should\ndeclare  and  Rahul  had  carried  on  batting.  The  two  situations  were  comparable  and,  if  anything,  the\nSydney declaration was far more significant and may have cost us a Test match and series victory. If\nRahul was so keen to show intent here in Multan, he should have done the same in Sydney.\nRahul didn’t say anything to this and stated that I would surely get another opportunity to score a\ndouble hundred. I disagreed, saying it would not be the same. I would have to bat from zero to score a\ndouble  century  and  would  not  be  starting  my  innings  at  194.  Before  I  brought  the  conversation  to  a\nclose, I assured Rahul that the incident would have no bearing on my involvement on the field, but off\nthe field I would prefer to be left alone for a while to come to terms with what had happened.\nDespite this incident, I am glad to say Rahul and I remain good friends, and even on the field our\ncamaraderie  remained  intact  until  the  end  of  our  careers.  We  continued  to  have  some  good\npartnerships and neither our cricket nor our friendship was affected.\nLearning from history\nA very similar situation arose a few years later, in December 2008, when we were playing England at\nMohali.  It  was  the  last  day  of  the  Test  match  and  Gautam  Gambhir  and  Yuvraj  were  both  in  the\nseventies. Yet again there was talk of a possible declaration in the dressing room. It was being argued\nthat we needed to declare immediately and put the English in for some thirty overs so that we could\ntry and force a win.\nI intervened and stopped the declaration. Dhoni was our captain then and Gary Kirsten our coach. I\nsaid  that  I  had  been  in  this  situation  before  and  did  not  want  a  repeat  of  what  had  happened  to  me.\nThere was no way we could win the game by putting the English in after lunch. There was not enough\ntime – particularly because on each day so far, play had finished early because the light in Mohali did\nnot last long and the last day was expected to be no different. In such a situation, what was the point of\ndeclaring  and  depriving  the  two  batsmen  of  the  chance  to  get  their  hundreds?  Gautam  had  already\nscored one in the first innings, so he had a rare opportunity to make a hundred in each innings. Yuvraj,\non the other hand, had played a key role in winning us the first Test at Chennai and it was only fair to\ngive him the chance of a Test hundred.\nFinally, I said it was our responsibility to look after the interests of all individuals who were part of\nthe  team,  because  a  bunch  of  happy  individuals  make  a  happy  team.  I  wasn’t  suggesting  that  we\nshould  place  individual  interest  ahead  of  team  interest.  However,  in  a  situation  where  there  was  no\nchance of winning the match, it was essential to give both batsmen a chance to get their hundreds. I\nconvinced Gary that it was the right thing to do for the team and was glad that he agreed with me.\nUnfortunately, however, both Yuvraj and Gautam missed their hundreds. Yuvi was run out for 86\nand  then  Gautam  was  out  for  97,  which  was  when  we  finally  declared  the  innings  at  251–7.  Soon\nafterwards, I joked with Yuvraj and Gautam, complaining that I had delayed the declaration for them\nboth and yet they had not scored their hundreds. In fun, I said to Yuvraj, ‘ Tumhe mein ek laath dunga,\ntum  run  out  ho  kar  aaye  for  86  aur  maine  tumhare  liye  declaration  ko  roka! ’  (I  will  kick  you.  I\nstopped the declaration for you and you got run out for 86!)\nA series win to remember\nIn the end it took us just thirty minutes on the final day to wrap up that first Test at Multan in 2004.\nBefore  that  I  had  had  a  part  to  play  with  the  ball  against  Pakistan  wicketkeeper  Moin  Khan.  I  had\ndismissed Moin before in exhibition games and started playing mind games with him, telling one of\nmy team-mates, ‘Main ise pehle bhi out kar chuka hoon. Aaj bhi yeh main isko out karunga.’ (I have\ndismissed him before and today also I will get him out.) Moin heard the conversation and smiled at\nme,  saying,  ‘Aaj  toh  main  tujhe  chakka  marunga.’  (Today  I  will  hit  you  for  six.)  I  told  him  that  I\npromised to flight the ball, so ‘Chalo mar ke dikhao.’ (Come on, try and hit me.) Then I shouted to my\nteam-mates to give Abdur Razzak a single and get Moin back on strike. For the last ball of the day, I\ndecided to bowl him a googly, because he was trying to pad up to every delivery. The ball pitched on\noff  stump,  turned  exactly  as  I  had  hoped  and  went  through  his  legs  to  hit  leg  stump.  It  was  a  key\nwicket and helped to swing the momentum in our direction. In the second Test at Lahore, however, we\nwere outplayed. Though Yuvi scored a very good hundred for us, we were always playing catch-up and\nwere never in the contest.\nThe third and deciding Test at Rawalpindi started on 13 April. Sourav was back in the side and to\nmaintain  balance  we  decided  to  open  with  Parthiv.  Lakshmipathy  Balaji  and  Irfan  Pathan,  our  two\nswing bowlers, bowled very well throughout the series and this match was no different. Balaji picked\nup  four  wickets  and  we  restricted  Pakistan  to  224  in  the  first  innings.  Then,  with  Rahul  leading  the\nway with a spectacular double hundred, we put 600 on the board in reply.\nThis time Pakistan had been outplayed and we finished the formalities on day four by bowling them\nout for 245. Anil took four wickets and I took the tenth and final wicket of the innings bowling leg-\nspin. Though the match was over on the fourth day, it was not without drama or embarrassment. That\nmorning we dropped four catches in no time. They weren’t difficult and we all seemed to be dropping\nthe ball like a hot potato.\nIt was a terrific series win and our first in Pakistan in fifty years. Coming at the back of the 3–2\nODI series win, it marked the end of a brilliant tour.\nIndia in Australia 2003–04 – The Border-Gavaskar Trophy\n1st Test.

            "title": "UNDER THE KNIFE\n",
            "data": "It  started  in Amsterdam,  of  all  places.  It  was  just  another  net  session  before  the  Videocon  Cup  tri-\nseries involving Australia and Pakistan towards the end of August 2004. Ajit Agarkar was bowling to\nme  and  bowled  a  short  one,  which  I  fended  off  with  one  hand.  I  instantly  realized  I  had  done\nsomething to my elbow. Andrew Leipus, our physio, didn’t like the look of it at all. It turns out he was\nright to be concerned.\nIt was an unfortunate situation because my in-laws had travelled to Amsterdam with their friends\nfrom  London  to  see  me  play  and  here  I  was  nursing  what  was  later  diagnosed  as  tennis  elbow.  To\ncomplicate  matters,  I  also  had  a  virus  and  for  a  good  three  days  couldn’t  set  foot  outside  my  hotel\nroom. I was desperate to get back in shape as quickly as possible because the ICC Champions Trophy\nin England started in September and in October Australia were due to arrive in India for a four-Test\nseries.\nI  did  all  I  could  to  get  the  elbow  injury  treated.  An  expert  in  Amsterdam  tried  to  help  it  by\nmanipulating my wrist. He suspected the elbow was being overloaded because of stiffness in my wrist,\nbut  unfortunately  those  painful  sessions  didn’t  help  much.  Then  I  tried  shockwave  therapy,  which\ninvolved a machine that looked like a hairdryer being placed on my elbow. The feeling reminded me\nof blowing up a balloon and at one point I thought my elbow was going to burst under the pressure.\nAnjali  was  about  to  join  me  in  England  and  I  called  her  to  say  she  should  bring  a  video  camera\nacross. I remember telling her that she would never see me in more physical pain, and we videoed one\nof the sessions to keep a record of what I had to go through. I was due to undergo three sessions but I\nurged  the  doctor  to  administer  a  fourth  one  if  he  thought  it  would  help  me  get  fit  quicker. Anjali’s\npresence  had  given  me  the  courage  to  press  on  with  the  recovery  and  I  was  desperate  to  get  fit,\nparticularly for the Test series against Australia. Seeing my desperation, one of the doctors asked me\nhow important that series was for me and why I was so determined to play. I said that it would be like\nmissing my own wedding reception and there was no way I would want to do that!\nDespite all my efforts, I was in no condition to take part in the Champions Trophy and I also had to\nmiss the first two Tests against Australia. It was extremely frustrating to be forced to sit out and watch\nClarke  and  Gilchrist  score  centuries  to  set  up  a  217-run  victory  for  Australia  in  the  first  Test  at\nBangalore, despite eleven wickets in the game for Harbhajan Singh. I even had a steroid injection on\nthe eve of the second Test match in Chennai, but it didn’t work. The Chennai Test was a draw and then\nfinally, after two weeks of complete rest, the pain had subsided enough for me to return for the third\nTest  at  Nagpur  on  26  October  2004.  It  wasn’t  the  greatest  comeback  match.  On  a  seaming  pitch,\nGillespie  took  nine  wickets  and  Damien  Martyn  just  missed  out  on  a  century  in  both  innings,  as\nAustralia won by 342 runs. My contribution was a disappointing total of ten runs.\nIn the final Test at the Wankhede Stadium the following week, Rahul and I were at the crease in the\nsecond innings when all of a sudden I felt a searing pain in my elbow again. It was at a critical stage in\na low-scoring match and I was worried that I had rushed the comeback and was going to let my team\ndown. I immediately asked for some painkillers and, thinking to myself that it would have an instant\neffect, decided to chew up two tablets rather than gulping them down. Gritting my teeth, I dug in and\nmanaged to battle my way to 55. With Laxman scoring a brilliant 69, we set Australia a target of 107\nin the fourth innings. Helped by another five-wicket haul from Harbhajan and three from the left-arm\nspinner Murali Kartik, who was the Player of the Match, we proceeded to bowl Australia out for just\n93 and won the match by 13 runs. The pain was definitely worth it. Unfortunately for Kartik, he did\nnot get another chance to play Test cricket for India after that.\nWe followed the Australia series with two home Tests against South Africa in November 2004. The\nfirst  at  Kanpur  was  a  draw,  but  the  second  at  Kolkata,  starting  on  28  November,  brought  a  very\nsatisfying  victory,  with  Bhajji  proving  a  match-winner  again,  this  time  taking  seven  wickets  in  the\nSouth African second innings.\nEven though I was still not fully fit, my contribution was gradually improving and by the time of\nthe first match in a two-Test series in Bangladesh in December, I was in good enough form to make\nmy highest Test score – 248 not out – at Dhaka. It was also my thirty-fourth Test hundred, equalling\nSunil Gavaskar’s world-record tally. He was actually commentating in Bangladesh at the time and he\nkindly sent me a fabulous gift of thirty-four bottles of champagne to make it a truly memorable day in\nmy career.\nThe elbow surgery\nIn March 2005 Pakistan were scheduled to visit us at home for three Tests and seven ODIs. It was a\ntour I really did not want to miss and I pushed myself as hard as I could, trying to ignore the soreness,\nbut I eventually realized that I was struggling for form and I wasn’t doing my elbow any good. It was\ntime to face the prospect of surgery, something I’d hoped to avoid.\nThe procedure was carried out on 25 May 2005 and I was told it would be four and a half months\nbefore I could hold a cricket bat. Those months were extremely difficult. I couldn’t help worrying that\nmy career might be over and would often pray to God that my career should not come to an end like\nthis.  It  was  very  frustrating  not  doing  anything  and  at  one  point  I  hung  a  ball  in  a  sock  below  our\napartment and tried doing some shadow practice with a plastic bat, but even that was really painful.\nThe last two months were the hardest. I could barely sleep and would have to go out for long drives in\nthe middle of the night with my friend Faisal Momen just to try and calm down a little.\nThe  first  games  I  played  after  the  surgery  were  in  a  domestic  competition,  the  limited-overs\nChallenger Trophy in Mohali in October 2005. The elbow was not completely back to normal but I felt\nit was time to try it out. In my very first day of practice I experienced some pain in my shoulder after\na throw. Here I was recovering from left elbow surgery and now my right shoulder was hurting. I put it\ndown to my prolonged absence from the game and went ahead with the games, but the pain increased\nwith each passing day and I even started having problems with my right elbow.\nI was in Baroda when I got to know that my surgeon, Dr Andrew Wallace, was in Delhi for a day.\nHowever, with no flight connections to Delhi from where I was, I was beginning to get worried about\nhow to get to him before he left. That’s when my good friend Amit Bhatia stepped in. Amit, who is an\nardent cricket fan, gave me a ride in his private jet and made sure I reached Dr Wallace in good time.\nOn  examining  my  shoulder,  Dr  Wallace  said  that  during  rehabilitation  athletes  often  put  too  much\nload  on  the  non-injured  limbs  to  compensate  and  it  was  likely  that’s  what  had  happened  to  me.  He\nasked  me  to  have  a  few  scans,  to  figure  out  the  nature  of  the  problem.  I  did  not  want  to  fuel  more\nspeculation in the media about my injury, so when I went to get the scans done, I resorted to wearing a\nburkha,  which  shows  how  difficult  things  were  at  the  time!  John  Gloster,  our  new  physio,\naccompanied me to the hospital and the scans revealed a small cyst next to a nerve. I was told I needed\nto get it removed as soon as possible, though I could play on for the moment.\nMy return to international cricket finally happened on 25 October 2005 in the first ODI of a series\nagainst Sri Lanka. It was a truly emotional moment when I took the field after six months out and the\nfirst  thing  I  did  was  to  look  up  to  the  heavens  and  thank  God  for  giving  me  another  opportunity.  I\nscored 93 and this time it was exactly the sort of comeback I had hoped for. My first scoring shot was\na  cover  drive  for  four  against  the  medium-pacer  Farveez  Maharoof  and  I  flicked  the  next  ball  to\nsquare  leg  for  another  boundary.  I  was  determined  to  make  the  most  of  this  lifeline.  We  won  the\nmatch by 152 runs and went on to take the series 6–1.\nIn  the  three-Test  series  that  followed  in  December  2005  I  scored  my  thirty-fifth  Test  century,\nmaking the world record my own. The hundred had eluded me for a while and at Chennai, the venue\nfor the first Test, I was beginning to wonder how long I would have to wait. Though most of the drawn\nChennai Test was lost to rain, something happened there that put me in good spirits: I had a dream in\nwhich I saw myself scoring the thirty-fifth hundred in Delhi, the venue of the second Test.\nI didn’t really expect it to work out that way, of course, but then towards the end of 10 December,\nthe very first day of the Delhi Test, I found myself in the nineties as the light began to fade rapidly.\nThe  umpires  were  discussing  whether  to  stop  play,  but  I  was  desperate  to  stay  out  there  and  was\npraying that they would continue the match for just another few minutes. They did so and Chaminda\nVaas, the left-arm fast-medium bowler, was put on to bowl. Vaas was bowling wide of my off stump\nwith a packed off-side field and I knew I had to try something different. I decided to play a chip shot\nbehind the wicket from way outside off stump, a shot no one would expect me to play just a few runs\nshort  of  my  century.  I  got  it  just  right  and  to  everyone’s  surprise  reached  97  with  a  well-calculated\nrisk.\nThe umpires checked the light again at the end of the over and to my relief decided to carry on. I\nknew I had at least a few more minutes to get to the hundred. In the next over from Vaas, by which\ntime  I  had  picked  up  two  more  singles,  I  had  already  made  up  my  mind  not  to  repeat  the  shot.  I\npredicted that Vaas would be expecting me to paddle-sweep and would change his line and bowl to me\non  the  stumps.  I  was  proved  right  and  he  bowled  a  ball  on  middle  stump  which  I  played  towards\nsquare leg for a single.\nI was so delighted at reaching the century that I did something very out of character. I shouted in\njubilation  and  celebrated  in  a  manner  I  had  hardly  ever  done  in  my  career.  I  was  very  proud  of  the\nachievement.  We  went  off  shortly  afterwards  and  when  I  got  back  to  the  dressing  room  I  couldn’t\ncontrol my emotions. With tears flowing down my cheeks, I made four phone calls – to Anjali, Ajit,\nmy mother and Achrekar Sir – to thank them for all they had done.\nWhile I managed to play in the Sri Lanka series, followed by three Tests against Pakistan in January\n2006  and  England  in  March  2006,  Tests  in  which  I  didn’t  do  a  great  deal,  I  realized  that  shoulder\nsurgery was unavoidable if I harboured any ambition of going to the West Indies for the Test series in\nMay. I decided not to play in the one-day series against England and went ahead with the operation on\n27 March in London.\nThe shoulder operation\nIt  wasn’t  quite  as  straightforward  as  planned. As  normal,  I  was  sedated  before  being  moved  to  the\noperating  theatre,  but  for  some  reason  I  suddenly  woke  up  on  the  trolley  and  asked  the  nurse  if  the\noperation was over. She was shocked to see me awake and told me that it had not even started. There\nhad been some complication with the previous operation and mine had been delayed. I drifted back to\nsleep but a little later woke up again and asked a doctor if the ordeal was finally over. To my surprise I\nwas told that this time they had had to wake me because of an unexpected discovery. They had spotted\na  ruptured  tendon  in  my  right  biceps  and  needed  my  consent  to  fix  it  while  they  did  the  shoulder\nsurgery. I agreed, but asked them to make sure I recovered in time for the West Indies series! In fact,\nas soon as I’d got back to my room from the operating theatre, I cried and cried because I thought I\nwas going to miss the West Indies series, which I was very eager to play in.\nWithin five weeks of the double surgery I picked up a cricket bat and even played a few shots to\ntennis  balls.  My  family  and  friends Atul  Ranade  and  Jagdish  Chavan  were  with  me  throughout  the\nrecovery and I got them to bowl at me from 18 yards to get used to the extra pace that I was likely to\nencounter in the West Indies. In hindsight I concede that I probably pushed myself too hard. When my\nphysio and doctors asked me to play thirty balls a day, I played sixty.\nAfter  practising  to  short-pitched  bowling  for  four  days,  I  asked  one  of  my  friends  to  bowl  at  me\nfrom  the  full  22  yards,  to  get  used  to  swing  and  seam  movement. All  was  fine  until  I  felt  a  sudden\njerk. I immediately stopped and one look was enough to frighten me. My biceps was hanging like a\nhammock and my first impression was that I had ruptured it again. I was desperate to speak to John\nGloster  and  report  what  had  happened,  but  John  was  then  in  the  West  Indies  with  the  team  and,\nbecause  of  the  time  difference,  I  had  to  wait  eight  or  nine  hours  before  I  was  able  to  speak  to  him.\nThose hours were a real nightmare. John advised complete rest for the next few days. The incident had\nreally shaken me up. A week later I went to Chennai and met up with our trainer, Ramji Srinivasan. I\nwanted to work on my physical fitness, even if I couldn’t bat. I trained hard for a week but it was to no\navail. I had lost confidence completely and decided not to go to the West Indies for the June 2006 Test\nseries.\nLed by Rahul Dravid, who had replaced Sourav Ganguly as captain, the team played outstandingly\nwell. Rahul batted brilliantly in truly trying conditions and we won the four-Test series 1–0. It was our\nfirst series win in the Caribbean for thirty-five years – and I was frustrated at missing every single bit\nof  the  action.  I  called  my  team-mates  after  the  victory  and  congratulated  them  on  a  fantastic  series\nwin.\nBy  the  time  the  team  returned  from  the  West  Indies  and  were  ready  to  go  to  Sri  Lanka  for  three\nODIs  in August,  I  had  recovered  enough  to  join  them,  though  throwing  was  still  a  bit  of  an  issue.\nDisappointingly, the Sri Lanka series was a washout – only twenty-two balls were bowled in the first\ngame because of rain and the second and third games were abandoned completely – although it did at\nleast allow me more time to recover. Frustrated because of all the rain, we ended up sitting out on the\nhotel-room balcony playing carrom.\nThe next tournament was a tri-series in Malaysia in September 2006 against Australia and the West\nIndies,  and  I  was  delighted  to  score  a  big  hundred  in  the  first  game  of  the  competition  against  the\nWest  Indies.  My  innings  of  141  not  out  finally  put  all  my  injury  concerns  to  rest,  though  it  was\ndisappointing to lose the rain-shortened match by the Duckworth-Lewis method.\nHeartened  by  my  successful  comeback,  I  kept  promising  my  team-mates  that  I  would  get  them  a\nrun-out in the tournament. I said that all the opposition players were aware of my injuries and were\nbound to take some risks against me, assuming I wouldn’t be able to throw hard. It happened exactly\nas  I  had  predicted  and  I  got  Australia’s  Damien  Martyn  run  out  when  he  took  on  my  arm  while\nfielding at third man. I celebrated by sprinting back to the wicket and my team-mates were delighted\nthat I had kept my promise. I was back.\nAustralia in India 2004 – The Border-Gavaskar Trophy\n1st Test.

            "title": "‘ENDULKAR’\n",
            "data": "My primary goal now was to win the 2007 World Cup in the Caribbean. We had made the final four\nyears earlier and had faltered at the very last hurdle. We were all desperate to go one better this time\nand expectations at home were very high.\nWe played well in our two practice matches against the Netherlands and the West Indies in Jamaica\nin early March. We scored 300 batting first against the Netherlands, for a decisive 182-run win, and in\nthe next match our bowlers polished off the West Indies for 85, setting up a nine-wicket victory. We\nseemed to be getting into a good rhythm for our first group match against Bangladesh on 17 March,\nbut  at  the  same  time  there  was  no  question  of  being  complacent  or  taking  them  lightly.  Bangladesh\nhad beaten decent opposition before.\nThe match was tough for many reasons. When we batted, the pitch was damp and it was extremely\ndifficult to play shots in the first ten overs. Mashrafe Mortaza, Bangladesh’s medium-fast bowler, was\nperforming well and we had lost two early wickets when I went in to bat. I was batting at number four\nin this competition, as requested by the team management. I was perhaps a little surprised to bat in\nthat position, because we had experimented with my batting position before, on the eve of the 2003\nWorld  Cup,  only  to  agree  that  I  could  contribute  most  as  an  opener.  But  the  team  management’s\ntheory was that the tracks in the West Indies would be slow and low and I would be able to manoeuvre\nthe  spinners  in  the  middle  of  the  innings. As  it  turned  out,  almost  all  the  wickets  had  bounce  and\nmovement and the strategy backfired on us.\nMy  plan  was  to  see  off  the  new  ball  before  gradually  picking  up  the  scoring  rate.  Sourav  and  I\nsuccessfully negotiated the early swing and, with the spinners on, I decided to play an inside-out shot\nover extra cover. Unfortunately the ball from left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak hit the inside edge of my\nbat, ricocheted into my pad and went on to hit the stumps. It was not the start to the World Cup I had\nhoped for.\nNot much went right for us on the day. Although Sourav scored 66 while opening the batting, Rahul,\nthe captain, made only 14 and then Dhoni got out for a duck trying to play a cut shot, caught at short\nthird man. It was one of those days when things just didn’t click and we ended up with a below-par\nscore of 191. In reply Tamim Iqbal, the left-handed opening batsman, gave Bangladesh a quick start\nand they managed to reach the target fairly easily in the end, with five wickets to spare.\nNot all was lost after one defeat, however, and there was still time to pull things round. We knew\nwe had to win the two remaining group matches and that the run rate might come into the equation. In\nour second match against Bermuda, we went out and played our shots and won by 257 runs. Thanks to\nour total of 413, the net run rate had been beefed up and we only had to beat Sri Lanka to progress to\nthe next stage.\nWe started well against Sri Lanka on 23 March and kept their score to a manageable 254. There’s\nlittle doubt that we were capable of chasing down that total, but despite our best efforts things did not\ngo to plan. I got an inside edge to a ball from fast bowler Dilhara Fernando; hearing the ball hitting the\nstumps in such a crucial match was devastating. When we were all out for 185 the dressing room was\nin  shock  and  some  of  the  players  were  in  tears.  Most  were  just  completely  silent.  I  found  it  very\ndifficult to get over the disappointment. It was definitely one of the lowest points of my cricket career.\nA difficult homecoming\nAfter we returned to India, the media followed me back home and it hurt when I heard my own people\ndoubting the commitment of the players. The media had every right to criticize us for failing, but to\nsay we were not focused on the job was not fair. We had failed to fulfil the expectations of the fans,\nbut that did not mean we should be labelled traitors. At times the reaction was surprisingly hostile and\nsome of the players were worried about their safety.\nHeadlines like ‘Endulkar’ hurt deeply. After eighteen years in international cricket, it was tough to\nsee things come to this and retirement crossed my mind. My family and friends like Sanjay Nayak did\nall they could to cheer me up and after a week I decided to do something about it. I started to do some\nrunning, to try to sweat the World Cup out of my head.\nOn top of all this our coach, Greg Chappell, was publicly questioning our commitment and instead\nof asking us to take fresh guard, was making matters worse. It seems to me that Greg Chappell must\ntake a lot of responsibility for the mess. I don’t think I would be far off the mark if I said that most of\nus felt that Indian cricket was going nowhere under Chappell.\nIn  my  opinion,  Indian  cricket  benefited  significantly  when  the  BCCI  decided  to  end  Chappell’s\ntenure  in April  2007.  Several  of  our  senior  players  were  relieved  to  see  him  go,  which  was  hardly\nsurprising  because,  for  reasons  hard  to  comprehend,  he  had  not  treated  them  particularly  fairly.  His\nattitude to Sourav, for example, was astonishing. Chappell is on record as saying that he may have got\nthe job because of Sourav but that did not mean he was going to do favours to Sourav for the rest of\nhis life. Frankly, Sourav is one of the best cricketers India has produced and he did not need favours\nfrom Chappell to be part of the team.\nChappell seemed intent on dropping all the older players and in the process damaged the harmony\nof the side. On one occasion, he asked VVS Laxman to consider opening the batting. Laxman politely\nturned him down, saying he had tried opening in the first half of his career because he was confused,\nbut now he was settled in the middle order and Greg should consider him as a middle-order batsman.\nGreg’s response stunned us all. He told Laxman he should be careful, because making a comeback at\nthe age of thirty-two might not be easy.\nUnlike John Wright and Gary Kirsten, who coached India before and after Greg and made a priority\nof  keeping  the  players  happy,  Greg  was  like  a  ringmaster  who  imposed  his  ideas  on  the  players\nwithout showing any signs of being concerned about whether they felt comfortable or not. In fact, I\nlater  found  out  that  Greg  had  spoken  to  the  BCCI  about  the  need  to  remove  the  senior  players,  no\ndoubt hoping to refresh the team.\nI also remember that every time India won, Greg could be seen leading the team to the hotel or into\nthe team bus, but every time India lost he would thrust the players in front. In general John and Gary\nalways preferred to stay in the background, but Greg liked to be prominent in the media.\nJust  months  before  the  World  Cup,  Chappell  had  come  to  see  me  at  home  and,  to  my  dismay,\nsuggested that I should take over the captaincy from Rahul Dravid. Anjali, who was sitting with me,\nwas equally shocked to hear him say that ‘together, we could control Indian cricket for years,’ and that\nhe would help me in taking over the reins of the side. I was surprised to hear the coach not showing\nthe slightest amount of respect for the captain, with cricket’s biggest tournament just months away. I\nrejected his proposition outright. He stayed for a couple of hours, trying to convince me, before finally\nleaving.\nA few days after Greg had come to my house, I suggested to the BCCI that the best option would be\nto keep Greg back in India and not send him with the team to the World Cup. I also said that we as\nsenior players could take control of the side and keep the team together. That’s not what happened, of\ncourse, and the 2007 campaign ended in disaster.\nGreg has since written a lot of things about the Indian cricket team. Perhaps it is time to set matters\nstraight. It came to light later that Greg was being filmed for a documentary, Guru  Greg, during  this\nperiod which went into a lot of detail about what was happening behind the scenes. It says a great deal\nabout his tenure as coach that I and other players did not even know about this. Why were the players\nnever asked if they felt comfortable with this? I wonder if he had permission from the BCCI to record\nhis documentary. Wasn’t it a clear infringement of the players’ privacy?\nWhile we may never get answers to these questions, suffice to say that Greg’s tenure as coach was\nthe  worst  of  my  career.  There  is  no  doubt  we  failed  as  a  collective  in  2007,  but  his  high-handed\nmanner added to our disappointment and, in the immediate aftermath of defeat, had a harmful impact\non Indian cricket.\nUnwelcome opinions\nThe outrage in India after the 2007 World Cup was not helped by armchair experts who were sitting\nthousands of miles away but still passing judgement on Indian cricket and suggesting I should ‘have a\ngood  long  look  into  the  mirror’  and  think  about  retiring.  Such  opinions,  which  were  published  in\nIndian newspapers, provoked fans across the country. I have never quite understood why Ian Chappell,\nwho was merely reporting on the game, should have got a headline in the Indian press. Would any of\nour  former  players  commenting  on  Ricky  Ponting  or  Michael  Clarke  have  had  a  headline  in  the\nMelbourne Age or the Sydney Morning Herald? Chappell would have done better to stick to Australian\ncricket.\nI remember meeting Ian Chappell in Durban in 2010 during the Champions League Twenty20 and\nhaving a most interesting discussion with him. I bumped into him as I was coming out of a health club\nafter  a  session  in  the  gym  with  my  physio,  Nitin  Patel,  who  was  party  to  the  entire  exchange.  Ian\nstarted the conversation by saying that now he knew the secret behind my scoring big runs. I reminded\nhim  that  he  was  conveniently  changing  his  stand,  considering  what  he’d  written  about  mirrors  and\nretirement in 2007. I said to him that I had not done what he suggested back then because I was well\naware of what I needed to do and how much cricket I had left in me.\nI also said that critics like him change with the wind. When the going is good, they write positive\nthings  and  when  the  going  gets  tough,  they  start  making  a  lot  of  negative  comments  without  ever\ntrying to find out what actually is going through a player’s body or mind. He then asked me if I had\nchanged the weight of my bat. I told him that I hadn’t changed a thing and was doing exactly what I\nhad  been  doing  for  twenty  long  years.  He  was  the  one  who  had  conveniently  changed  his  opinion\nbecause I had been scoring heavily between 2008 and 2010.\nFinally  the  conversation  moved  to  Greg.  I  told  Ian  bluntly  that  Greg  had  not  been  popular  and  I\nwould not want to share a dressing room with him again. Ian attempted to argue that Greg had always\nhad a problem trying to understand failure and had had issues as captain of Australia. I said that that\nwas not my concern and all that mattered to me was that he had failed to take Indian cricket forward.\nIan was most surprised to hear all this. In fact, Nitin Patel told me soon after that I was the last person\nhe had expected to lash out like this.\nA welcome phone call\nAll in all, I was in a bad state after the 2007 World Cup. I was not enjoying my cricket at all and was\nthinking about retiring – until I received some encouraging words from Viv Richards. Out of the blue,\nhe called me in India from the West Indies and we spoke for about forty-five minutes. He assured me\nthat  there  was  a  lot  of  cricket  left  in  me  and  insisted  that  I  shouldn’t  even  think  about  stopping\nplaying.\nViv was my hero when I was growing up and he will always be a hero, no matter what success I’ve\nachieved myself. We have got to know each other well over the years and whenever we meet, he treats\nme like his younger brother and I treat him like my older brother. I’ve always respected him and his\nviews, so when he chose to call me and spend all that time convincing me to carry on, it meant a great\ndeal to me. When I finally got back into some good form and put together a very satisfying century in\nSydney at the beginning of 2008, I made a point of calling Viv to thank him for his crucial support.\nIndia in the 2007 World Cup\n8th match, Group B.

            "title": "BAD LANGUAGE\n",
            "data": "The process of getting Indian cricket back on track after the World Cup started with a two-Test series\nin Bangladesh in May 2007, which we won 1–0. Ravi Shastri, who was interim coach, played a key\nrole  in  helping  us  put  the  disappointment  of  the  Caribbean  behind  us.  Personally,  it  was  a  welcome\nchange, because Ravi and I have always been very good friends. Not only did we play together in the\nearly  years  of  my  career,  but  even  after  Ravi’s  retirement  we  spent  a  reasonable  amount  of  time\ntogether  on  tours  when  he  was  commentating.  He  has  an  astute  cricket  brain,  and,  with  his\nstraightforward and transparent attitude, we felt that we finally had a coach we could confide in.\nIn June we went to Ireland for a limited-overs series against South Africa. I was particularly excited\nabout  visiting  Ireland  because  my  favourite  rock  band,  U2,  come  from  there.  The  series  posed  an\nunusual  challenge  for  us  because  it  was  freezing  cold  and  it  took  us  a  while  to  get  used  to  the\nconditions.  Despite  the  weather,  I  had  a  good  outing  and  twice  got  out  in  the  nineties  in  the  three-\nmatch contest, which we won 2–1.\nI also remember the series for an incident with Yuvraj during dinner in Belfast. I suggested to some\nof my team-mates, including Yuvraj and Zaheer, that we should have some Japanese food one evening\nand we found a restaurant that served Thai, Chinese and Japanese cuisines. We ordered a number of\nentrées, including some sushi and sashimi. They served wasabi with the sushi and also gave us some\nbread rolls to go with the other starters.\nI asked Yuvi if he liked wasabi and he swore that he did. To our amazement, he then proceeded to\nspread  the  hot  wasabi  on  a  roll  as  if  it  was  butter  and  was  just  about  to  pop  it  in  his  mouth  when  I\nstopped  him.  Zaheer  was  kicking  me  under  the  table,  telling  me  to  let  him  eat  it,  just  to  see  what\nhappened. The wasabi was very strong, though, and there is no doubt that if he had eaten that roll he\nwould have been in serious trouble!\nWe  forced  Yuvi  to  admit  that  he  had  never  tried  wasabi  before  and  we  ribbed  him  mercilessly,\nthough he tried to put on a brave face.\nIndia in England, July–August 2007\nAfter the Ireland tour we went to England for a series of Tests and ODIs. The first Test started on 19\nJuly 2007 and I have to say we were fortunate to avoid defeat after Michael Vaughan’s England had\nput themselves in a good position. Anderson and Sidebottom had taken nine wickets between them as\nwe were dismissed for 201 in our first innings, and Kevin Pietersen’s spectacular 134 had helped to set\nus a target of 380 in our second innings. On the last day of the match we were nine wickets down and\nstruggling when Steve Bucknor ruled Sreesanth not out, even though it appeared that he had been hit\nright in front of middle stump. The match was stopped shortly afterwards because of rain and it was a\nlucky escape.\nWe played much better in the second Test at Nottingham a week later, and on the first day, which\nwas also curtailed because of rain, we took control. We dismissed England for under 200, thanks to\nexcellent  bowling  from  Zaheer  Khan  and  Anil  Kumble,  with  good  support  from  RP  Singh  and\nSreesanth,  and  followed  up  with  a  total  of  481.  Five  out  of  our  top  six  batsmen  passed  50  without\ngoing  on  to  make  a  century.  I  contributed  91  before  being  given  out  lbw  by  Simon  Taufel.  He  later\ncame to see me to admit that it had been a mistake on his part and that he had seen from replays that\nthe ball was clearly missing the stumps. It added to my respect for Simon and we are still good friends\ntoday.\nOur innings was tinged with controversy when Zaheer Khan had an unusual welcome to the middle.\nWhen he reached the wicket, Zaheer saw several jelly beans sprinkled on the crease. Clearly it was a\nprank by one of the England players. Zaheer removed the jelly beans but they reappeared as soon as he\nwas back on strike. Zaheer directed a few words at Kevin Pietersen at gully – though it was never clear\nwho was actually involved – and when he came back to the pavilion he was furious. He shouted to the\nteam that we needed to play aggressive cricket and finish England off in the second innings. Zaheer is\nnormally  a  cool  guy  and  he  very  rarely  gets  angry.  It  was  a  blessing  in  disguise  for  us,  as  Zaheer\nbacked up his words with one of his best ever spells in Test cricket, taking five wickets and leading us\nto  a  famous  victory.  We  went  on  to  win  the  Test  series  1–0  and  the  recovery  that  had  started  in\nBangladesh was complete.\nWe celebrated heartily, in which we were greatly helped by Rajiv Shukla, our manager for this tour.\nRajiv was a positive presence throughout the tour, and had been part of the team in some of our most\ncrucial  away  victories,  including  the  NatWest  tri-series  win  in  2002.  On  that  occasion  he  took  the\nentire  team  out  to  dinner  at  the  Four  Seasons  to  celebrate  the  victory  and  also  organized  a  special\nperformance of the musical Bombay Dreams, something we very much enjoyed.\nWe were playing some very good cricket by now and were looking forward to taking on Australia in\nOctober  2007  in  a  series  of  ODIs  in  India  before  heading  Down  Under  for  a  full  tour  a  couple  of\nmonths later. Before that ODI series, however, Indian cricket received a huge fillip when we won the\ninaugural  World  Twenty20  in  South  Africa  in  September  under  MS  Dhoni.  I  was  not  part  of  the\nTwenty20 team, of course, but I watched the team’s progress with great interest. The Twenty20 win\nhelped  restore  the  nation’s  passion  for  cricket  and  the  players  received  a  hero’s  welcome  on  their\nreturn to India.\nIndia in Australia, December 2007–January 2008\nIndia’s tour to Australia in 2007–08 was perhaps the most eventful series of my career. While we had\ncome  close  to  beating Australia  in  2003–04,  drawing  the  series  one  apiece  and  dominating  the  last\nTest  in  Sydney,  we  played  even  better  in  2007–08.  Even  though  the  Test  series  is  still  talked  about\nbecause  of  an  incident  involving  Andrew  Symonds  and  Harbhajan  Singh  in  Sydney,  a  lot  of  other\nissues combined to make it an extremely intense couple of months.\nWe were full of confidence by the time we set off for Australia. After the series of ODIs in India in\nOctober, which Australia won 4–2, we had played Pakistan at home in November and early December\n2007 and won the three-Test series 1–0. Most of the batsmen were in good form and we were hopeful\nof  achieving  our  first  ever  series  win  Down  Under.  Unfortunately,  before  the  first  Test  at  the  MCG\nthere was only one warm-up game, as is often the case with scheduling these days, and even that was a\nnear  washout  because  of  a  storm,  which  meant  we  had  very  little  chance  to  adjust  to  Australian\nconditions.\nFirst Test, Melbourne, 26–29 December 2007\nWe  had  a  reasonable  first  day  at  the  MCG,  picking  up  nine  Australian  wickets,  and  we  quickly\nfinished off their innings the next morning for 343. Anil and Zaheer had bowled well and now it was\ndown to the batsmen. I came in with the score at 31–2.\nI  had  thought  carefully  about  the  way  I  would  approach  my  innings  and  had  a  plan  for  each\nAustralian bowler. In fact, a glance at my scoring chart for the series will show up where I played the\nbig shots: I really went after the bowling in the area between long on and midwicket. This was based\non  my  experience  of  playing  the  Australian  attack  in  the  one-dayers  in  India  a  couple  of  months\nbefore, when the left-arm chinaman bowler Brad Hogg had caused us problems. I was determined to\nattack him because I knew it would force the Australians to rethink their plans. If they couldn’t rely on\nHogg, the fast bowlers would have to bowl longer spells than expected and we could attack them when\nthey got tired in the hot and testing conditions. I went into the Melbourne Test with a set plan against\nHogg. However, once in the middle, I realized that I needed to play differently and changed my plan\non the ground itself. Looking at his field placements, I started taking the aerial route and hit him in the\narea between deep midwicket and long on, forcing him to change his game plan and remove the close-\ncatching fielders. This strategy paid off and I could subsequently milk singles, with no men close on\nthe leg side. For other bowlers, however, I stuck to the same game plan that I had originally decided.\nBrett Lee bowled at his best in this series. Back in 1999 Lee had been fast but raw; in 2008 he was\nthe complete package. He had real pace, a vicious bouncer, a yorker, a fast swinging delivery and also\na slower ball. He was consistently clocking 145 kph and I relished my contests with him. Among the\nother bowlers, Mitchell Johnson bowled some incisive spells, while the accurate Stuart Clark had the\njob of trying to keep things tight. To his credit, he also picked up some key wickets.\nI went after the bowling from the start of my innings. I was feeling good and was set to kick on for a\nbig  score.  However,  you  don’t  always  get  a  hundred  just  because  you’re  feeling  good  and  I  got  out\nafter scoring 62. We were all out for 196, which was nowhere near enough. Australia soon managed to\nestablish a stranglehold over us, eventually winning the Test in four days. It was not the start we had\nhoped for.\nRed faces all round\nSomething unexpected that I had to deal with at the time of the Melbourne Test was a severe allergic\nreaction. On our way to Australia, Harbhajan Singh and I had bought a newly launched moisturizing\ncream at Singapore airport and for the first few days I had no problems using the cream. It was during\nthe first Test that I started feeling a serious burning sensation on my face. Harbhajan did not have any\nsuch problem, so at first I attributed my reaction to a massage. I had had to lie down with my face on a\ntowel and I thought it must have been something to do with the detergent used on the towel.\nThe problem started to bother me on the third day and I remember putting more cream on my face\nbefore going to bed, thinking it would help. The next morning I awoke in agony. My face was on fire\nand it was as if someone had pushed it into a barbecue. It was even worse by the evening with my face\nall red and swollen. So much so that I was too embarrassed to go out in public and had to hide behind\nlarge sunglasses.\nAnjali was arriving in Sydney the next day. With the Melbourne Test over on the fourth day, I got\npermission to fly to Sydney a little earlier than planned and met up with her and the children at the\nairport. They were horrified by my face and asked what on earth I had done to it. I was not in the best\nof moods and wanted to get to the hotel as quickly as possible. When we finally arrived, after a forty-\nfive-minute drive because of the traffic, I was really irritable. The hotel staff then took a long time to\ngive us our rooms and I ended up shouting at the hotel manager. By the time we got to the room I had\nstarted to feel worse and told Anjali to ask the kids to sit in the adjoining room and leave me alone.\nThe  poor  kids  were  wondering  what  was  wrong  with  me  to  behave  like  this.  By  then,  my  face  was\ntroubling me even more. We called Reception and asked for a doctor to come to my room but were\ntold that there wasn’t one available at that hour. I asked where the nearest hospital was and went there\nimmediately. After a brief examination, I was given a lotion for the night and was asked to come back\nthe following morning.\nWe got a taxi from the hospital and after a few minutes the driver said to me in Hindi, ‘ Aap wohi ho\njo main samaj raha hoon.’ (I think you are the person I think you are.) I admitted that I was and he\noffered to show us around Sydney, which I was in no mood to do. I asked him if he wouldn’t mind\ntaking us to a fast-food place instead and Anjali got out to get some burgers for dinner while I waited\nin  the  cab.  The  driver  accompanied  her  and  when  they  returned  she  told  me  that  he  had  insisted  on\npaying for the food. He also refused to take any money from us after dropping us off at the hotel and\nleft his number in case we needed to go anywhere else in Sydney during our stay. I was very touched\nby the gesture and told him that I would leave match tickets for him at Reception. Later I got one of\nmy Test shirts signed by the team and left it with the tickets.\nI  returned  to  the  hospital  the  following  morning  and  asked  the  doctor  to  do  whatever  he  thought\nnecessary  to  give  me  some  quick  relief,  as  I  had  a  Test  match  to  play  the  following  morning.  The\ndoctor  was  a  little  taken  aback,  considering  my  condition,  but  I  was  absolutely  determined  to  play.\nThat afternoon we were supposed to be practising but I was in no state to stay out in the sun. I ended\nup batting against my dear friend Subroto Banerjee, the former India medium-fast bowler, who was\nthen a resident of Sydney, in the indoor nets for a good forty-five minutes. I managed to take the field\nthe  next  day,  however,  and  that  was  the  first  time  I  wore  a  floppy  white  hat,  which  from  then  on\nbecame  my  trademark  on  the  field.  I  applied  a  lot  of  ice  to  my  face  and  then  plastered  it  with  zinc\ncream. It looked ridiculous but that didn’t bother me.\nAfter a couple of days, it finally started to settle down and I looked almost human again.\nSecond Test, Sydney, 2–6 January 2008\nWe suffered a blow on the eve of the Sydney Test when Zaheer was forced to return to India with a\nheel  injury.  Someone’s  loss  is  always  another  person’s  gain,  however,  and  Zaheer’s  return  meant\nyoung Ishant Sharma would get an opportunity to play in Australia for the first time.\nOn the first day, we started well and soon had the Australians on the ropes, with six wickets gone\nfor only 134, four of which were taken by RP Singh. Just when we seemed to be in control and were\ntrying to press home the advantage, what seemed to us to be an error by umpire Steve Bucknor caused\na shift in momentum. Andrew Symonds was ruled not out after he had very clearly edged the ball to\nDhoni off Ishant – the sound was heard not just by the players but also by the spectators. My son heard\nthe  sound  of  the  edge  sitting  in  the  stands  and  reminds  me  whenever  we  discuss  the  Sydney  Test\nmatch. Symonds stood his ground and, riding his luck, got a very important century for Australia. His\n162 changed the course of the game and Australia managed to put together a total of 463 after being in\na  lot  of  trouble.  That  wasn’t  their  only  piece  of  luck,  though.  Even  before  Symonds  had  been  given\nthis  reprieve,  Ricky  Ponting  had  been  adjudged  not  out  by  umpire  Mark  Benson  after  he  seemed  to\nedge a ball down the leg side.\nThe best response was to go out and make some runs. I was glad to make amends for missing out in\nMelbourne  by  making  154,  and  it  was  a  delight  to  watch  Laxman  score  a  hundred  at  the  other  end,\nwith Rahul and Sourav also chipping in with half-centuries. But just when the momentum seemed to\nbe swinging our way, Andrew Symonds started swearing at Harbhajan, who was batting with me and\nplaying really well.\nBhajji  had  gone  past  50  when  it  all  started.  For  a  number  of  overs  he  had  been  telling  me  that\nAndrew Symonds was trying to get him riled. I asked Bhajji not to rise to it but to continue batting the\nway he was. I knew only too well that by retaliating he would just play into the Australians’ hands.\nThe best thing to do is to ignore such provocation. That’s easy enough to say, but of course it’s not\nalways so easy to keep your cool at moments of intense pressure.\nBhajji was doing his best and was actually trying to be civil with some of the Australian players,\nincluding  Brett  Lee,  when  all  hell  broke  loose.  Bhajji  had  playfully  tapped  Lee  on  the  back after\ncompleting  a  run  and  Symonds  at  mid  off  took  exception  to  this.  He  apparently  did  not  want  an\nopposition player meddling with Lee and once again hurled abuse at Bhajji. Bhajji is an impulsive and\npassionate individual and it was only a matter of time before he would retaliate, which he soon did.\nThat was the start of the controversy that almost caused the tour to be called off.\nI want to state very clearly that the incident arose because Andrew Symonds had been continually\ntrying to provoke Bhajji and it was inevitable that the two would have an altercation at some point.\nWhile walking up to Bhajji to try to calm things down, I heard him say ‘Teri maa ki’ (Your mother …)\nto Symonds. It is an expression we often use in north India to vent our anger and to me it was all part\nof  the  game.  In  fact,  I  was  surprised  to  see  umpire  Mark  Benson  go  up  to  Bhajji  and  speak  to  him.\nWhile the umpire was talking to Bhajji, some of the Australian players started to warn him of the dire\nconsequences of his words, presumably to rattle him and disturb his concentration. The ploy paid off\nwhen a few overs later Bhajji was out for 63.\nI thought the matter had ended with Bhajji’s dismissal and later I was surprised when I was told that\nthe Australians had lodged a formal complaint at the end of that day’s play, apparently alleging that\nBhajji had called Symonds a ‘monkey’, which was being treated as a racial insult. What surprised me\nmost was the haste with which the Australians had lodged their complaint. I was later informed that it\nhad  apparently  been  agreed  between  the Australian  and  Indian  boards  during  their  tour  of  India  in\nOctober  2007,  following  an  incident  in  Mumbai,  that  the  respective  captains  were  to  report  to  the\nmatch  referee  any  incident  with  a  racial  element.  Even  so,  I  still  believe  that  the  matter  would  not\nhave  been  blown  so  out  of  proportion  if  Ponting  had  discussed  it  with  the  captain  Anil  Kumble,\nHarbhajan and the Indian team management before reporting the incident to Mike Procter, the match\nreferee. In turn, Mike Procter could also have handled the matter with a little more sensitivity.\nSoon after the end of play on the third day we were informed by Mike Procter that there would be a\nformal hearing on the incident at the end of the fourth day, which was later changed to the end of the\nmatch. It did not leave us in the best frame of mind in the middle of an intense contest. While it was\ndistressing to hear that Symonds felt he had been racially abused, it was equally distressing to observe\nwhat  Bhajji  was  going  through.  As  far  as  we  were  concerned,  he  had  retaliated  in  the  face  of\nprovocation, which was par for the course in an Australia–India cricket match. But he did not racially\nabuse another cricketer.\nWith  the  controversy  overshadowing  everything,  the  Test  match  assumed  a  completely  different\ncharacter.  By  the  fifth  day  we  were  batting  to  save  the  game.  Mind  you,  there  is  little  doubt  in  my\nmind that we would have drawn had it not been for what seemed to us to be mistakes by the umpires\nand some rather unsportsmanlike conduct by a few of the Australian players.\nRahul  Dravid  was  given  out  caught  behind  off  Symonds  for  38  by  umpire  Bucknor  when  his  bat\nseemed to be a fair distance away from the ball. The wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist was standing up to\nthe stumps at the time and was in the best position to see if the ball had touched Rahul’s bat. Yet he\nwho  prided  himself  on  walking  off  if  he  nicked  the  ball  appealed  for  the  caught-behind  and  to  our\ndisbelief we saw the umpire raise the finger. It was a shocking decision. Some of us actually wondered\nif Rahul had been given out lbw.\nA few overs later, Sourav was given out by umpire Benson after Michael Clarke and Ricky Ponting\ndecided  to  appeal  for  what  we  thought  was  a  grassed  catch  at  slip.  Finally,  umpire  Bucknor  gave\nDhoni out leg-before when to us the ball would clearly have missed the stumps. It seemed that every\ndecision that could go against us had done so.\nAfter the Test had ended with an Australian victory in the dying minutes of the fifth day, the Indian\nteam were instructed to stay behind at the ground for the Bhajji hearing. Despite this, however, I was\nthe  first  person  to  go  out  and  congratulate  the  Australians,  regardless  of  all  the  controversy  and\ndisappointment.  In  those  circumstances,  to  have  to  hang  around  in  order  to  testify  on  an  important\nincident like that wasn’t ideal, to say the least.\nThe  hearing  was  conducted  rather  strangely,  it  seemed  to  me,  with  the  Australians  and  Indians\nasked  to  testify  separately,  without  the  other  side  being  present  in  the  room.  This  certainly  didn’t\nimprove the trust between the Indian and Australian players. I was the principal witness because I was\nbatting at the other end from Bhajji and I recounted the incident to the match referee in detail. Apart\nfrom Bhajji himself, Chetan Chauhan, our manager on this tour, MV Sridhar, the media manager, and\nAnil Kumble, the captain, were also called.\nMike Procter did not look very convinced by our version of events and we found it surprising that\nhe asked us to wait in our dressing room till well past midnight. In fact, it was not until 2 a.m. that we\nwere allowed to return to our hotel. The controversy had started to cast a pall over the series. After the\nhearing there was serious ill-feeling between the two teams and we felt betrayed by the turn of events.\nStanding up for justice\nWe  were  preparing  to  travel  to  Canberra  the  day  after  the  Sydney  Test  to  play  a  first-class  fixture\nwhen  we  heard  that  Bhajji  had  been  banned  for  three  matches.  We  had  had  enough.  It  was  just  not\nacceptable and we decided it was time to take a stand against the judgement. We did not agree with\nwhat  the  referee  had  done  and  felt  that  the  hearing  at  Sydney  had  been  something  of  a  farce.  We\ninformed the BCCI of the players’ feelings and held a team meeting to decide what to do about it.\nAnil Kumble and I took the lead and it was unanimously decided that we would boycott the tour if\nBhajji’s ban was upheld. Anil is one of the politest cricketers I have known but he is also very strong-\nminded. I have great admiration for the role he played as captain during this controversy. We decided\nto  lodge  an  appeal  against  the  ban  and,  in  a  gesture  of  protest,  we  also  decided  not  to  travel  to\nCanberra – even though we had already loaded all our cricket gear into the bus. It was time for stern\nwords and strong action.\nThe BCCI was behind us all the way and duly lodged a formal appeal contesting the ban. Mr VR\nManohar, one of India’s legal luminaries, was handling our case. We had regular conversations with\nhim and provided him with all the relevant details. I must reiterate that we were very serious about the\nboycott. If Bhajji’s ban was upheld, it would mean an acceptance of guilt and imply that Bhajji had\nracially  abused  Symonds,  which  he  most  certainly  had  not.  We  were  fully  prepared  to  accept  the\nconsequences  of  walking  out  of  a  tour,  knowing  that  such  an  action  might  have  resulted  in  the  ICC\nbanning  the  Indian  team.  The  issue  was  now  bigger  than  just  Bhajji.  Indians  all  over  the  world  felt\nslighted and we felt it was our responsibility to stand up for our cause.\nHaving made our decision, we needed to find some way of reducing the tension. In the end we went\nto Bondi Beach and played a game of volleyball. It had a magical effect. It served as a fantastic team-\nbonding session and helped give us the determination to carry on. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, the media\nfollowed us wherever we went, particularly Bhajji. On a lighter note, I remember saying to him that he\nmust  be  the  second  most  popular  man  in  the  world  after  Michael  Jackson,  with  so  many  cameras\nfollowing him. In fact, I called him MJ for some time during and after the controversy.\nThird Test, Perth, 16–19 January 2008\nOnce we had lodged our appeal, we agreed to go to Perth for the third Test. On the eve of the match\nthe  ICC  had  flown  in  Ranjan  Madugalle,  its  senior  match  referee,  in  an  attempt  to  defuse  the\nsimmering  tension  between  the  two  teams.  A  meeting  was  staged  between  the  two  captains  at  the\nHyatt Hotel in Ranjan’s presence and Anil and Ricky shook hands for the cameras. In reality nothing\nhad changed. The unpleasantness of Sydney would not go away and a number of issues remained to be\nstraightened out at the WACA, where India had never won a Test.\nThe Perth Test turned out to be one of the best Test matches I was involved in. There is little doubt\nin my mind that the controversy had brought us together as a team. Sehwag was back and he gave us a\nquick  start  against  Brett  Lee,  Mitchell  Johnson,  Shaun  Tait  and  Stuart  Clark  on  the  first  morning,\nhelping us to win the first skirmish. He only scored 29 but it was enough to set the foundation for the\nmiddle order. Rahul and I then put together a very important partnership of 139.\nIt was in this innings that I had one of my toughest contests with Brett Lee. He bowled at real pace\nand I had to be at my best. I hadn’t been in long when Lee bowled a fast bouncer. The shot I played\nstill  gives  me  a  lot  of  satisfaction.  I  readied  myself  to  play  the  upper  cut  over  the  slips,  but  then  I\nrealized that the ball was jagging back at me at furious pace. Within a fraction of a second the ball was\njust inches away from my head. I kept my eyes on the ball and was leaning back at almost 45 degrees\nwhen  I  finally  met  the  ball  with  the  bat  right  in  front  of  my  eyes.  The  ball  flew  over  the\nwicketkeeper’s head to the boundary. After that, I had a feeling it was going to be a good day. I went\non to make 71 in our score of 330, with Dravid contributing 93.\nAnil picked up his 600th Test wicket in Australia’s first innings when he had Symonds caught by\nRahul  at  slips. Anil’s  uncharacteristically  exuberant  celebration  was  an  eye-opener  for  all  of  us  and\nshowed  how  much  the  wicket  meant  to  the  team  after  the  Sydney  Test.  Breaking  the  partnership\nbetween  Symonds  and  Gilchrist  proved  crucial.  We  went  on  to  bowl Australia  out  for  212,  with  RP\nSingh  taking  four  wickets,  giving  us  a  118-run  lead.  We  had  set Australia  a  target  of  413  and  were\nbeginning  to  scent  victory.  But  there  was  still  a  job  to  be  done  and  there  was  no  room  for\ncomplacency.\nThe final day was a classic piece of Test cricket. In fact, Ishant Sharma’s spell of fast bowling that\nmorning  was  one  of  the  best  spells  by  an  Indian  bowler  in  all  my  years  of  international  cricket.\nPonting and Michael Hussey came in intent on staging a fightback after Irfan Pathan had picked up the\ntwo openers the previous evening. Anil had set a good field to Ponting and Ishant was given the ball. It\nwas inspiring to see an Indian fast bowler bowl at real pace to one of the world’s premier batsmen and\nmesmerize him with balls that came in from a good length.\nThe length Ishant was hitting was the key. I was standing at mid on and kept reminding him to bowl\nthe same line and length over and over again. There was no need for anything fancy, as he already had\nPonting in some difficulty. I could also sense Ponting trying to upset Ishant by threatening to come\nforward, to force him to alter his length. It was a true test between bat and ball and I was impressed to\nsee Ishant stick to doing exactly what had been asked of him.\nBy the end of eight overs Ishant showed no reduction in pace. He had beaten Ponting on numerous\noccasions but somehow the batsman had survived. It was an important moment. If he managed to play\nIshant off, Ponting would be able to relax and we would have missed an opportunity. Anil, however,\nwas tempted to give Ishant a rest – until some of the senior players persuaded him to allow Ishant one\nmore go at Ponting.\nThe gamble paid off and Ishant finally got Ponting to edge one to Rahul at slip. It was a just reward\nfor a great piece of fast bowling. We had our man and could now have a crack at the Australian middle\norder. We kept taking wickets at regular intervals and in the end it was the left-arm seamer RP Singh\nwho clean-bowled Stuart Clark to give us an amazing victory.\nReasons to be cheerful\nAfter the game a number of bottles of champagne were opened in the dressing room and one was also\nsent across to the touring Indian media contingent, who had played a very important role in standing\nbehind us during the Sydney controversy. I’m pleased to say that Brett Lee and Adam Gilchrist also\ncame to our dressing room to congratulate us and it was a gesture that was much appreciated.\nAs I look back at the Perth Test a few things stand out. We arrived in Perth with a sense of purpose.\nWe all felt hurt by what had transpired in Sydney and the best way to vent our anger was on the cricket\nfield. And that is what we did.\nThe second thing I remember about Perth is the arrival of Gary Kirsten, who had been nominated as\ncoach  of  India  but  who  was  yet  to  take  charge.  Gary  did  not  say  much  at  first  and  just  wanted  to\nobserve  how  the  Indian  players  went  about  their  routines.  It  was  Gary  who  suggested  that  the  team\nshould go cycling in Perth, to get our minds off cricket for a while. It certainly did us a lot of good. At\nsuch times net practice is not always the only answer. No one will ever become a Sunil Gavaskar or a\nKapil  Dev  in  two  days  of  practice.  It  is  just  as  important  to  recharge  mentally  and  it  often  helps  to\nspend some time together away from the cricket field.\nFinally, the support of the fans was particularly memorable. We were 2–0 down in the series and a\nlot had been written about the fragility of the team on the fast and bouncy WACA track. None of this\ngloomy talk stopped the Indian fans from coming and lending their support. It was terrific to see the\ntricolour being waved in the stands and it was a reminder of what the game meant to Indians all round\nthe world. It felt good to have made them proud.\nWe  had  proved  that  the  Indian  team  could  play  within  the  spirit  of  the  game  both  on  and  off  the\nfield.\nFourth Test, Adelaide, 24–28 January 2008\nAs we prepared for the final Test at Adelaide, Gary asked me if I wanted to bat in the nets and I said\nI’d prefer to practise to some short-pitched throw-downs. This was the start of a ritual that continued\nfor four years, with Gary throwing hundreds of balls to me before every game. He never seemed to get\ntired and his commitment to the job was amazing.\nWhen  he  asked  me  at Adelaide  if  I  wanted  to  practise  against  short  throw-downs,  I  asked  him  to\nthrow  full  and  fast  at  me,  because  I  had  a  feeling  Brett  Lee  would  bowl  a  full-length  delivery  the\nmoment I went in, as he had got me out with a full delivery at Perth. Sure enough, as soon as I walked\nout  to  bat  at  the Adelaide  Oval,  Lee  bowled  a  delivery  at  my  pads.  I  was  prepared  and  instead  of\nplaying square, which perhaps he was expecting me to do, I played a straight drive past the umpire for\nfour. After the stroke I looked towards Gary in our dressing room.\nI went on to score 153 and we put more than 500 runs on the board, with Sehwag and Bhajji both\nscoring 63 and Kumble playing a captain’s innings down the order of 87. Australia batted just as well\nin response, with Hayden, Ponting and Clarke all making hundreds, and the match ended in a draw –\nbut  only  after  Sehwag  had  added  an  impressive  151  in  our  second  innings.  We  had  not  managed  to\nlevel the series but we had won back credibility and respect.\nThe final verdict\nBefore bringing down the curtain on the controversial ‘Monkeygate’ saga, as it had been dubbed in the\npress,  Justice  John  Hansen  heard  everybody’s  evidence  in  the  appeal  on  28  January  2008.  I  stated\nexactly what I had heard and seen and also said that I had taken exception to us being labelled ‘liars’\nby the match referee, Mike Procter, who had mentioned in his statement that ‘I believe one group is\ntelling the truth’. That he banned Bhajji for three Test matches seemed to us to show which group, in\nhis opinion, was lying. It is never a pleasant thing to be called a liar and I was extremely angry.\nIn the end justice prevailed. The verdict of the appeal was that there was no evidence to suggest the\nuse of a racist remark by Bhajji and the ban was lifted. Instead Bhajji was fined half of his match fee\nfor using abusive language against Symonds. Bhajji could finally breathe a sigh of relief and we as a\nteam felt vindicated.\nIndia in Bangladesh 2007\n1st Test.

            "title": "BOUNCING BACK\n",
            "data": "The  2008  one-day  tri-series  in  Australia  with  Sri  Lanka  as  the  third  team  was  a  hard-fought\ncompetition. A lot of the tension from the controversial Test series that preceded it was carried into\nthe limited-overs arena and the Indian team under new captain MS Dhoni were determined to return to\nIndia with the Commonwealth Bank trophy.\nThe pitch at the MCG on 10 February was one of the fastest I’ve played on. We fielded first and\nDhoni was standing way back and still had to catch most balls at chest height. I was standing at slip,\nwhich  was  at  the  edge  of  the  thirty-yard  circle,  an  indication  of  the  pace  and  bounce  of  the  pitch.  I\nremember mentioning to Dhoni, after an outside edge off Matthew Hayden’s bat flew past me, that the\npitch was going to favour the fast bowlers throughout the match and no chase was going to be easy.\nOur  bowlers  used  the  conditions  well  and  dismissed  Australia  for  only  159.  Ishant  bowled\nbeautifully again to pick up 4–38 and Sreesanth also did well, taking 3–31. At the break our dressing\nroom was buoyant, though we knew that their fast bowlers would enjoy the conditions just as much.\nSure enough, in the third over of the innings Lee bowled a fast short ball that flew off the shoulder of\nmy  bat  over  slip  towards  third  man.  Just  as  I  was  completing  the  single,  Lee  walked  up  to  me  and\ncasually said with a smile that he was feeling very good and was going to bowl really fast at me. Lee\nhas always been a good friend and while it wasn’t exactly sledging, it was enough to fire me up. As he\nwalked past I just muttered to myself that, come what may, I was going to take him on. It turned out to\nbe one of our most memorable contests.\nMy chance came in the fifth over. Sehwag had just been dismissed at the other end, lbw to left-arm\nseamer Nathan Bracken for 11, and Lee was steaming in. His second ball was slightly wide but I still\ndecided to go for a drive through cover. I connected moderately well and the ball raced to the fence.\nLee just gave me another smile and walked back to his mark. I thought I knew what he would try next.\nHe ran in fast and, as anticipated, bowled a fuller-length ball. I came down hard at it and hit it straight\nback at him. It must have been one of the most powerful shots I have hit in my life. Lee didn’t have a\nhope  of  bending  down  to  stop  the  ball.  In  fact,  the  ball  had  reached  the  boundary  by  the  time  he\nfinished his follow-through.\nBy now Lee was even more pumped up and the next ball was a 151 kph delivery, which I defended\noff the back foot. I was determined to keep attacking and I got another opportunity off the fifth ball of\nthe over. It was full and fast and again I hit it back past Lee for four. While the first straight drive had\ngone to the left of the bowler, this one went to his right. Those two drives gave me a lot of confidence\nand  I  went  on  to  make  44.  When  I  got  out  in  the  twenty-sixth  over  we  needed  64  runs  and  Rohit\nSharma and Dhoni played well to finish off the job.\nImmediately  after  the  match,  I  started  to  feel  some  soreness  in  my  adductors,  the  muscles  in  the\ngroin, and informed John Gloster about the problem. We took remedial steps but the pain refused to\ngo  away  and  I  was  still  feeling  it  when  we  played  our  last  pool  match  against  Sri  Lanka  on  26\nFebruary in Hobart. It was a game we had to win to qualify for the three-match final against Australia.\nSri Lanka scored 179, with Ishant Sharma and Praveen Kumar both taking four wickets, and when our\ninnings started I managed to connect well from the off and went on to make 63 as we knocked off the\nruns in thirty-three overs. It felt good to spend time out in the middle again after several low scores\nand I headed to Sydney for the first final relieved at having scored some runs.\nWhile I was looking forward to the finals, I was conscious that the pain in my adductors was getting\nworse  after  every  practice  session.  I  was  having  problems  with  running,  twisting  and  even  bending\ndown to pick up a ball. It reached a stage where in fielding practice I had to just stand at the stumps\nwhile  my  team-mates  threw  the  ball  in.  With  the  final  just  a  day  away,  painkillers  were  the  only\nremedy.\nCB Series, first final, Sydney, 2 March 2008\nBefore the finals, the atmosphere got a little heated again when Ricky Ponting declared that Australia\nwould  have  to  play  only  the  first  two  of  the  three  finals,  as  that  was  all  it  would  take  to  send  India\npacking. His comments only added to our determination.\nAustralia batted first at the SCG after winning the toss. It’s usually a sensible ploy to bat first in a\nbig final, because even a mediocre score can be made to look good in a must-win situation. Australia\nmade 239 on the day, with Matthew Hayden contributing 82, and we didn’t think it was a bad total in\ngood bowling conditions.\nRobin Uthappa was opening the batting with me and our first task was to see off the new ball. We\nknew that if the team batted our full fifty overs, we should win the match, and I advised Robin to be\npatient and not to be aggressive early in the innings. Being a naturally attacking batsman, Robin was\nitching  to  play  his  shots  and  at  one  point  I  had  to  get  a  little  angry  with  him,  telling  him  not  to  do\nanything rash. We managed not to lose a wicket until the eleventh over, when Robin played his first\nbig  pull  shot  to  deep  square  leg,  where  Mike  Hussey  caught  the  ball  low  down.  Robin  might  have\nscored only 17, but he had helped see off the new ball and we had put together a 50-run first-wicket\npartnership.\nI sensed that the match would be ours if we kept our nerve. Unfortunately for us, we lost Gautam\nGambhir and Yuvraj within a few overs and needed another partnership to rebuild the innings. Rohit\nSharma had come out to bat and I asked him to play straight and not try any fancy shots early on. He\nbatted brilliantly and soon we were in a position to grind down the opposition. Rohit finally got out to\nthe all-rounder James Hopes for 66, just after I had reached my century.\nDhoni came out next and we knocked off the 30 runs needed to finish the match quite easily in the\nend. The only scare was a beamer from Brett Lee that hit me on the side of my helmet grille and the\ntop of my left shoulder. The ball had slipped out of his hand and could very easily have injured me. I\nfelt a little dizzy and jokingly suggested to Lee that he would have to answer to my son Arjun when he\nnext went to Mumbai. Lee knew Arjun well and had spent some time with my family when we had\nfilmed  a Boost commercial together. He apologized immediately and the matter was put to rest there\nand then. It was an accident, of course, but the shoulder felt sore and the area between shoulder and\nelbow turned black.\nIt was a very satisfying feeling to bat through the innings. It was a big match but we decided not to\ncelebrate  too  much  because  the  second  final  in  Brisbane  was  only  a  day  away  and  we  knew  it  was\ngoing to be tough because of the high humidity.\nI could not sleep a wink that night and ached all over. The pain in my groin had increased and I was\nstarting to get scared. The next morning I could barely walk and it was an ordeal boarding the early-\nmorning flight. In Brisbane I was given a long massage as soon as we reached the hotel. Seeing my\ncondition, Dhoni suggested that maybe I should miss the second final and play in the third if needed. I\nsaid  to  him  that  ‘Sher  jab  gira  hua  hota  hai  use  tabhi  mar  do’  (When  a  tiger  is  down  and  out,  just\nfinish it off. Don’t give it a second chance.) He agreed with me that it would be better to close out the\ncompetition in Brisbane if we could.\nCB Series, second final, Brisbane, 4 March 2008\nWhen we arrived at the Gabba we found that there was a lot of moisture in the pitch. It was bound to\nbe difficult for batting early on and the obvious plan was to field first if we won the toss – but I urged\nDhoni  not  to  do  so.  I  reckoned  that  the  Australians  might  well  want  to  bat  first,  preferring  to  bat\nwithout the pressure of chasing a target. I thought it would be better if we set a target, even if it meant\nstruggling through the initial period of dampness on the wicket.\nDhoni agreed and we batted first. Again, I told Robin Uthappa in no uncertain terms not to risk a\nsingle expansive shot till we had played out the first ten overs. In those conditions not losing wickets\nwas far more important than trying to score runs. Robin successfully held back and we survived the\nfirst twenty overs intact, giving us a solid foundation to launch an assault. We then scored at almost\nsix runs an over and ended up with 258, a reasonable score to defend in the circumstances.\nI was pleased to score 91, but by the end of the innings I also knew that my body was in bad shape\nand if we weren’t able to win in Brisbane I would be in no condition to play the third final. In fact, I\nwas forced to leave the field in the fourth over of the Australia innings, when Dhoni dived to catch\nHayden  off  Sreesanth  and  the  ball  ricocheted  and  hit  me  exactly  where  I  had  been  hit  by  the  Lee\nbeamer.\nMeanwhile our opening bowler Praveen Kumar produced a great spell and picked up three crucial\nAustralian wickets. Hayden and Symonds then put together a big partnership and the stage was set for\nBhajji  to  have  the  final  word  on  Australian  soil.  First  he  ran  Hayden  out,  following  a\nmisunderstanding  with  Symonds,  and  then  just  two  balls  later  Symonds  missed  a  ball  that  turned  a\nlong way and was trapped lbw. Unsurprisingly, Bhajji enjoyed his wicket more than any other.\nThe match wasn’t over yet, however, with James Hopes playing some aggressive strokes. In the end,\nHopes was out last, for 63, but by picking up wickets regularly at the other end we had ensured that he\nwas constantly under pressure. Nevertheless, the match was closer than expected and when the final\nwicket fell, Australia were only ten runs away from winning the game.\nIt was a great feeling to win, and seeing the tricolour being waved all over the Gabba was a terrific\nsight.  We  had  beaten Australia  in Australia  and  were  also  delighted  to  have  proved  Ricky  Ponting\nright. He did not have to play a third final, just as he had predicted.\nGrasping the nettle\nMy physical condition was deteriorating by the day. It didn’t help that the problem still hadn’t been\ndiagnosed  properly  and  I  didn’t  know  exactly  what  I  was  suffering  from.  In  any  case,  there  wasn’t\nmuch  time  to  do  anything  about  it  as  the  first  of  three  home  Tests  against  South Africa  was  due  to\nstart at Chennai a couple of weeks later, on 26 March 2008.\nAfter getting as much rest as I could, I went to Chennai, and in the evening before the game had\nthree injections in my groin. The doctors sounded confident that they would enable me to play the next\nday. When I got up the following morning the pain was substantially reduced, but John Gloster and I\ndecided  I  should  undertake  a  fitness  test.  I  found  I  was  able  to  run  around  during  practice  and  also\nplayed our customary game of football without feeling too much discomfort. John declared me fit to\nplay.\nIt  was  unlucky  for  me  that  South Africa  won  the  toss  and  then  batted  for  two  long  days  as  they\ncompiled 540, with Amla making 159. Fielding in the heat quickly brought back the pain and when I\nfinally batted on the fourth day I was so stiff and sore that I got out without scoring to Makhaya Ntini,\ncaught by Kallis at second slip. At the end of the match, which was a high-scoring draw, I told Anil\nKumble and John Gloster that there was no point in pushing my body any further.\nI flew back to Mumbai and embarked on a process of rehabilitation under Nitin Patel, the physio of\nthe Mumbai Indians, the IPL team of which I had been made captain. The first season of the IPL was\njust  round  the  corner  and  my  initial  aim  was  to  get  fit  for  the  first  match.  Despite  all  my  efforts,\nhowever, I was only able to play the last seven matches, and even then I was not 100 per cent fit.\nThe  lack  of  a  diagnosis  led  to  some  unhelpful  speculation.  Apparently,  one  doctor  in  Mumbai\nsuggested to a member of the Mumbai Indians management that the problem was actually in my head.\nI found out about it because one night Anjali asked me if the problem was really bad enough for me\nnot  to  play.  How  could Anjali  ask  me  such  a  question?  I  said  to  her  that  I  had  played  with  broken\nfingers  and  toes,  and  played  days  after  my  father’s  death,  so  how  could  she  of  all  people  doubt  my\nphysical  condition?  It  was  not  until  the  competition  had  finished  that Anjali  told  me  what  she  had\nheard from a Mumbai Indians official about what the doctor had said. Frankly, I was shocked, but I\nwas  also  glad  she  didn’t  tell  me  until  the  end  of  the  tournament,  because  I  was  trying  everything\npossible to get fit and play, and it would have been very upsetting to hear that.\nUnfortunately  for  me,  no  one  in  Mumbai  could  diagnose  the  problem,  despite  the  fact  that  I’d\nundertaken  various  forms  of  treatment.  Finally,  it  was  in  London,  when  I  was  there  for  a  family\nholiday,  that  I  met  up  with  my  surgeon  Andrew  Wallace  and  explained  my  condition.  He\nrecommended Prof. Cathy Speed, who, on seeing the case history, immediately identified my problem\nas Gilmore’s Groin, or Sportsman’s Hernia, and referred me to Dr Ulrike Muschaweck in Germany.\nProf.  Speed  also  prescribed  a  few  medicines  and  gave  me  some  exercises  to  do  and  I  felt  in  good\nenough shape to go to Sri Lanka with the team for the Test series in July and August 2008. I managed\nto get through the series, which we lost 2–1, without too much trouble, but before the start of the one-\nday series it was apparent to me that I had to do something about the condition.\nOn 13 August 2008, I left for Munich alone to get myself treated by Dr Muschaweck at the Munich\nHernia  Centre.  It  was  a  great  revelation  for  me  to  discover  this  very  specialized  centre  for  hernia\ntreatment.  Dr  Muschaweck  was  highly  recommended  by  Prof.  Speed.  She  has  been  specializing  in\nhernia surgery for close to two decades and has developed some new repair techniques in recent years\nthat  have  considerably  improved  the  recovery  process.  She  immediately  makes  her  patients  feel  at\nease and she was quick to assure me that there was no chance of recurrence once she had operated on\nme. To my delight she was proved right.\nI had the first operation on 14 August and must say the pain was perfectly bearable. I had asked Dr\nMuschaweck  if  both  sides  of  the  groin  could  be  done  on  the  same  day  but  was  told  that  it  wasn’t\nfeasible because there would be far too much pain. Anjali hadn’t been able to accompany me initially\nbecause  of  Sara’s  examinations,  but  she  joined  me  on  the  evening  of  the  14th  and  I  underwent  my\nsecond  operation  on  the  morning  of  the  15th.  I  had  insisted  on  having  the  two  operations  on\nconsecutive  days  to  cut  down  the  recovery  time,  in  the  hope  of  getting  fit  for  the  Australian  Test\nseries.  This  time  the  pain  was  excruciating.  Cleaning  myself  was  quite  an  ordeal  because  of  the\nserious pain in my abdomen and I wasn’t able to eat a thing. I was given a laxative and this, a sweet\nsugar syrup with a very nice taste, was the only thing I enjoyed having that night! I could hardly sleep\nwith all the pain and was looking forward to getting back home.\nIt was an important operation and one that helped prolong my cricket career. It also draws attention\nto  the  lack  of  specialized  sports  science  centres  in  India  at  that  time.  While  I  could  afford  to  go  to\nMunich and get myself treated by the best experts in the world, for other Indian athletes it might not\nalways have been feasible.\nI certainly knew I’d had a serious operation afterwards. I remember leaving the clinic on 16 August\nin a wheelchair because I felt dizzy every time I tried to stand. I also remember telling Anjali that I\nwas  about  to  faint  when  standing  at  the  check-in  counter  at  the  airport  and Anjali  rushing  to  help.\nAfter landing in Mumbai, my friend Faisal Momen picked me up and for the first time in my life I\nasked him to drive as slowly as possible. I was frantically monitoring the road and if I spotted a speed\nbump I would lift myself a little with my hands to avoid jarring my abdomen.\nAs soon as I got home Anjali told the kids that for the time being they wouldn’t be able to give their\nfather  a  hug.  At  that  time,  Arjun  used  to  like  play-fighting  with  me  and  I  had  to  show  him  the\nbandages to make him understand that I was just too unwell. It was a difficult time for us all. I had\nalready missed days and months of my children’s childhood. Now I was finally at home with them all\nday but was unable to play with them.\nOnce I’d got over the journey, I started the recovery process under the aegis of Paul Close and Paul\nChapman. I did not go out for three weeks during rehab, as I was so tired from all my training, which\nwould  start  at  seven  in  the  morning.  I  spent  the  second  week  of  my  rehab  at  the  National  Cricket\nAcademy,  and  my  training  included  strengthening  exercises,  cardio,  pool  sessions,  running  –  both\nstraight  and  sideways  –  specialized  exercises  with  the  Thera-Band,  and  a  number  of  other  drills.  It\nwould end at around two thirty in the afternoon, following which I would just go home, have lunch and\nsleep for a few hours, completely exhausted.\nThe  target  I  had  set  myself  was  to  recover  for  the  Test  series  against  Australia  that  started  in\nBangalore at the beginning of October 2008. I knew it would be a race against time and I had a lot of\nhard  work  ahead  of  me.  There  were  days  when  I  would  push  myself  so  hard  that  by  the  evening  I\nwould  just  collapse  on  the  bed  and  had  no  strength  left,  then  I  would  get  up  very  early  the  next\nmorning and start my exercises all over again. Throughout this period, my group of friends, including\nAtul Ranade, Sameer Dighe and Jagdish Chavan, were always there to motivate me and would train\nwith me all day. Their presence was a great help and I remain ever indebted to them for their support.\nAustralia in India, October–November 2008\nIt  was  a  great  relief  to  be  back  on  the  field  for  the  first  Test  against  Australia  in  Bangalore  on  9\nOctober. Australia  made  430  in  their  first  innings,  with  Ponting  and  Hussey  both  making  hundreds,\nand we made 360 in reply. I scored only 13 in my first innings, but did better in the second innings\nbefore falling to the leg-spin of Cameron White. I scored 49 but, more importantly, I was able to bat\nfor close to three hours and faced more than a hundred balls without feeling discomfort. The match\nwas drawn and we headed to Mohali for the second of the four Tests.\nThe  series  had  assumed  greater  significance  because  Sourav  had  announced  that  he  would  be\nretiring at the end of the fourth Test at Nagpur. Sourav and I always had a great rapport and we shared\na lot of great moments together. As teenagers, we both spent a month at an Under-15 camp and were\npart  of  Kailash  Gattani’s  touring  team  to  England.  We  played  together  for  over  a  decade  in  Test\ncricket and opened the batting for India in countless limited-overs international matches.\nOne of the habits that we got into was that every time I felt that Sourav was tense or that there was\nsomething  troubling  him,  I  would  say  something  random  to  him  in  Bengali,  which  is  his  mother\ntongue. Often my words made little sense but they were good enough to make him laugh. There was\nno doubt I was going to miss him. I remember trying to persuade him to carry on, but he was sure it\nwas time to call it a day.\nIn the second Test at Mohali, starting on 17 October, I scored a fluent 88 in our total of 469 before\nfalling to Peter Siddle, caught at slip. My timing was definitely coming back. In the process I passed\nBrian  Lara’s  tally  and  reached  the  figure  of  12,000  Test  runs.  This  achievement  was  marked  by  a\nfantastic fireworks display at the ground. It went on for close to three minutes and I felt privileged and\nhonoured  at  the  affection  heaped  on  me.  Mr  Inderjit  Singh  Bindra,  one  of  Indian  cricket’s  most\ndistinguished administrators, who was then president of the Punjab Cricket Association, told me that\nthere were more fireworks than the total number of runs I had scored. I felt overwhelmed. The PCA\nhas  always  been  a  great  host  and  is  an  institution  that  has  made  playing  in  Punjab  that  much  more\nspecial.\nFrom the start of Australia’s first innings, our bowlers were bowling really good lines and managed\nto  put  the Australian  batsman  under  pressure.  The  ball  was  reverse-swinging  and  both  Zaheer  Khan\nand  Ishant  Sharma  were  making  the  most  of  the  conditions.  In  contrast,  the Australian  bowlers  had\nfound it difficult to get their rhythm right and Gambhir, Sehwag and Dhoni had all made big scores\nagainst them.\nTo everyone’s delight, Sourav scored a hundred in the first innings. I couldn’t have been happier for\nhim and remember how he celebrated what was to be his final Test hundred with a pump of his fist\nand then raised his arms to acknowledge the well-deserved applause.\nThe Mohali match is also memorable for me because of the catch I took in the Australian second\ninnings. I was fielding at point when Simon Katich tried to cut Bhajji past me for four. He mistimed\nthe shot and I had to dive forward to reach the ball. I managed to get both hands under it and it was\ngreat to feel the leather on my hands. Such a quick reaction put quite a strain on my groin muscles, but\nI got up unhurt and the relief was evident on my face. My hard work during the recovery had paid off.\nIt was also an important breakthrough for us in the game and we were able to get into the Australian\nmiddle order sooner than expected. Zaheer and Ishant bowled exceptionally well and it was perhaps\nthe  best  I  have  seen  Zaheer  bowl.  He  was  getting  the  ball  to  move  late  and  the Australian  batsmen\nstruggled  against  late  swing.  It’s  a  shame  Zaheer  suffered  so  many  injuries,  otherwise  I’m  sure  we\nwould have seen his match-winning abilities on many more occasions.\nWe beat the Australians at Mohali by 320 runs and moved to Delhi for the third Test on 29 October\nleading the four-match contest 1–0. There we managed to keep the momentum going and were happy\nwith  a  draw,  thanks  mainly  to  double  hundreds  in  the  first  innings  by  both  Gautam  Gambhir  and\nLaxman. I scored 68 and felt comfortable enough to believe that a big score wasn’t far away; I just had\nto be patient.\nThat Delhi Test turned out to be Anil Kumble’s last and it was an extremely emotional moment for\nus all. Anil was one of the biggest match-winners India has produced and we had played together for\nclose to two decades. I was very surprised when he said he was thinking of retiring. He felt he was not\nbowling close to his best and was not able to give 100 per cent for the team. My argument was simple.\nEven 80 per cent of Anil Kumble was good enough for most batsmen and India still needed him.\nI almost managed to persuade him to carry on but an injury to his spinning finger on the third day of\nthe Test was the final straw. He had just recovered from a shoulder surgery and with the finger injury,\nwhich required eleven stitches, he simply couldn’t bowl. We carried him on our shoulders and it was a\nfitting finale for one of international cricket’s true all-time greats.\nHis final speech was very emotional for all of us and the crowd gave him a standing ovation. I’m\nglad  to  say  we  managed  to  convince  Anil  to  come  to  Nagpur  for  the  last  Test  to  be  a  part  of  the\ncelebration if India went on to win the series. It was only right that Anil should be there, because he\nhad  captained  us  in  two  of  the  first  three  Tests  and  had  also  been  the  captain  when  we  played  in\nAustralia earlier in the year.\nWe  started  well  at  Nagpur  on  6  November,  with  an  opening  partnership  of  close  to  a  hundred  by\nSehwag  and  Vijay,  but  then  lost  two  quick  wickets.  I  managed  to  build  decent  partnerships  with\nLaxman and Sourav, with a number of lucky breaks going my way. I was dropped in the eighties and\nnineties and I told Sourav that God wanted me to score a century on the occasion of Sourav’s farewell\nTest match.\nIn his final Test Sourav scored a valuable 85 for the team. We managed 441 in our first innings but\nI still felt we were 100 runs short. It was a good batting wicket and the Australians raced on in the last\nsession  of  day  two  to  finish  at  189–2.  We  knew  we  could  not  afford  to  let  them  get  away  the  next\nmorning.  We  had  to  try  something  different  to  make  them  think  and  take  some  risks,  because  they\nwere the ones under pressure to level the series. I suggested to Dhoni that we needed to slow down the\ngame, and after that we employed an 8–1 field, with eight fielders on the off side and one on the on,\nsomething  hardly  ever  tried  in  Test  cricket,  to  Michael  Hussey  and  Simon  Katich,  and  despite\ndropping Katich early on we managed to restrict the runs. Zaheer and Ishant bowled well to the field\nand Australia just could not get away.\nThey added only 42 runs before lunch and Ishant also dismissed Simon Katich in the process. That\nwicket changed everything and we took a further three in the session between lunch and tea, conceding\njust  49  runs.  The  momentum  had  shifted  and  we  knew  we  were  back  in  control.  We  eventually  set\nAustralia  a  target  of  382  in  their  second  innings,  and  then  Amit  Mishra,  the  leg-spinner  who  had\nreplaced Anil, and Harbhajan Singh finished things off midway through the second session on day five\nand we won the series 2–0.\nThe  celebrations  went  on  into  the  night  and  both  Anil  and  Sourav  were  asked  to  give  speeches.\nGary, who had played a huge role behind the scenes, had organized the farewell at the VCA Club in\nJamtha and it was a day everyone who was there will cherish for ever. The whole team stayed on in\nNagpur  for  this  very  special  occasion  and  I  did  the  same,  despite  having  to  miss  Anjali’s  fortieth\nbirthday. I knew that, as always, she would understand and pardon my absence.\nIndia in Sri Lanka 2008\n1st Test.

            "title": "THE IPL\n",
            "data": "The Indian Premier League, the franchise-based Twenty20 competition that started in April 2008, has\nhad a revolutionary impact on world cricket. It seems to have captured the imagination of the modern\nfan and has attracted the best players from around the world. I am convinced that the IPL will continue\nto be a permanent feature of the global cricket calendar, just as it has already become a part of Indian\nhouseholds every April and May.\nDespite sometimes being played in rather adverse weather conditions and on occasions outside of\nIndia, most of the games have been played to sell-out crowds. And this is not restricted to the smaller\nvenues. In May 2013, people came out in droves to support quality cricket, despite all the talk of spot-\nand match-fixing surrounding the tournament. I was disappointed, shocked and angry at the goings-on,\nand  said  so  in  a  press  release  at  the  time.  There  has  to  be  a  complete  zero-tolerance  policy  against\ncorruption and more should be done to educate the players, but on the other hand the tournament as a\nwhole cannot be blamed for the wrongdoings of a few.\nThere is little doubt that the IPL has added an entirely new dimension to Indian cricket. Not only\nhas  interest  grown  in  domestic  competitions,  but  there  is  also  a  spill-over  effect  that  has  helped\nimprove general awareness about domestic cricket. It has certainly made domestic performances more\nsignificant,  with  players  knowing  that  playing  well  on  the  domestic  circuit  may  earn  them  an  IPL\ncontract.\nEarly fears\nWhen the IPL was originally launched by the BCCI in late 2007, there was, understandably, a lot of\napprehension surrounding the tournament. Indian cricket had to come to terms with the club culture,\nand the concept of player auctions was alien to the average Indian cricket fan. No one was quite sure\nwhat standard the cricket would be or whether fans would come out to support the tournament in the\noppressive heat of April and May.\nA confession is in order here. While I never had any doubt that the IPL would be popular, I did not\nexpect the tournament to take off quite so quickly. Secondly, I did not expect the standard of cricket to\nbe so high. The matches in the IPL are played with as much intensity as international cricket and the\nlevel is very close to the highest international standard. Players turning up for the franchises always\ngive  their  best  and  the  fans  appreciate  this  and,  of  course,  they  also  enjoy  seeing  the  world’s  best\nplayers in action alongside the best of Indian domestic talent.\nDifferences from international cricket\nThere  are  some  fundamental  differences  between  the  IPL  and  international  cricket.  One  is  the  close\ninvolvement of the team owners. Their presence adds to the character of the tournament. For example,\nsome have their own peculiar superstitions, which they impose on the team. In one team the owner’s\npriest decides when the players should leave their hotel rooms on match days, and the players go along\nwith this. Whatever state the players are in, they have to leave the room.\nAnother team owner believes in ‘vastu’ (which is a little like feng shui) and their dressing room is\nalways organized in a particular manner, with mirrors set at specific angles. Once in a match against\nus  this  team  even  went  ahead  and  changed  our  dressing  room,  putting  in  mirrors  just  as  they  did  at\ntheir home venue. In turn, we changed this arrangement late at night and all the mirrors were covered\nwith towels to unsettle the opposition.\nOn another occasion we were told by one team management not to use a washroom in our dressing\nroom and a sign was placed outside it declaring ‘BATHROOM OUT OF ORDER’. One of the players\ncouldn’t resist going in, just to have a look, only to discover that it was working perfectly. Eventually,\nthe team made a point of using that particular bathroom and we even went on to win the game!\nAnother  key  difference  from  international  cricket  concerns  culture. Almost  all  the  players  in  the\nIndian team come from a similar background and are well versed in the Indian system of playing the\ngame  by  the  time  they  make  the  national  team.  In  the  IPL,  there  can  be  vast  cultural  differences\nbetween a rookie Indian youngster and an established international stalwart, which makes the need for\nteam  bonding  all  the  more  important.  Looking  after  the  youngsters  and  making  sure  they  are  not\noverawed  are  added  responsibilities  for  team  owners,  senior  management  and  senior  players.  I  have\nparticularly enjoyed mentoring young Indian talent and trying to act as a bridge between them and the\ninternational professionals playing for the Mumbai Indians.\nImpact on Indian cricket\nThat the IPL has had a profound impact on Indian cricket is beyond doubt. The benefits are obvious,\nbut there are also a few concerns that need to be taken seriously if the tournament is to evolve further\nin the years to come.\nOn  the  plus  side,  the  IPL  has  contributed  to  improving  international  player  relations.  The  best\nexample is the case of Andrew Symonds and Harbhajan Singh. In the fourth season of the IPL in 2011,\nSymonds  and  Bhajji  played  for  the  Mumbai  Indians.  I  clearly  remember  our  first  meeting  with\nAndrew when he joined the team. I told him that the Sydney controversy of 2008 was in the past and\nthat neither I nor Harbhajan would ever refer to the incident in our dealings with Andrew. Andrew, for\nhis  part,  reciprocated  the  camaraderie  and  we  became  good  friends.  We  played  some  really  good\nmatches side by side and I am sure when we meet next we will share the same chemistry.\nSince the start of the IPL, none of the India–Australia series have featured the kind of acrimony on\nshow during the 2008 tour. In IPL season six in 2013, for example, I had the opportunity to play with\nRicky Ponting. Ricky and I had played international cricket against each other for years but the only\ninteraction  we  had  had  before  playing  together  for  the  Mumbai  Indians  was  the  occasional  hello.\nSuddenly we were sharing the same dressing room and opening the batting together. It was enriching\nto get to know Ricky better and understand his perspectives on the game. I also enjoyed opening the\nbatting with Sanath Jayasuriya in IPL season two, Shikhar Dhawan in season three and Dwayne Smith\nin season five.\nThe transformation in player relations has also had a knock-on effect on spectator behaviour at IPL\nmatches. For example, when Shane Warne, playing for the Rajasthan Royals, rushed to congratulate\nthe Indian all-rounder Yusuf Pathan after his Super Over heroics against the Kolkata Knight Riders in\nSouth Africa in 2009, the large Indian diaspora at the stadium was spontaneous in applauding Warne\nfor his gesture.\nPerhaps  the  biggest  benefit  of  the  IPL,  however,  is  that  it  offers  the  Indian  domestic  cricketer  an\nopportunity to play with the best in the world. There are plenty of players in India who are good but\nhave narrowly missed the opportunity to represent their country. Some of them might be on the wrong\nside of thirty and have little hope of playing for their country. The IPL has given a lot of these players\nrecognition unthinkable a few years earlier, as well as respect and a good income. The IPL is the best\nplatform after international cricket at the moment, with a massive presence of international stars, and\nthe Indian domestic players get a share of the glory associated with the international game by playing\nin the IPL. IPL performances are covered in detail in the media and the status of the domestic Indian\ncricketer has improved as a result.\nYoung rookies cutting their teeth in Twenty20 cricket have also benefited from the competition. To\nbe  able  to  face  up  to  Dale  Steyn  or  Morne  Morkel  in  the  nets,  share  a  dressing  room  with  Jacques\nKallis,  AB  de  Villiers  or  Kevin  Pietersen,  practise  and  play  alongside  the  likes  of  Chris  Gayle  or\nMichael  Hussey  is  a  dream  come  true  for  Indian  youngsters.  They  have  a  chance  to  learn  from  the\ngreats of the contemporary game. In the Mumbai Indians, the youngsters can play in the nets against\none  of  the  best  Twenty20  bowlers  in  the  world  in  Lasith  Malinga,  rub  shoulders  with  the  likes  of\nKieron Pollard and discuss bowling techniques with Anil Kumble, the mentor of the team. I absolutely\nloved it when Malinga, fielding at mid on, walked up to Dhawal Kulkarni, the Mumbai medium-fast\nbowler, and offered him tips. These are gains that go far beyond the monetary riches offered by the\nIPL. For established Indian players, there are other benefits to be had. Invaluable knowledge about the\nstrengths and weaknesses of players from other countries can be gained from playing with and against\nthem in the IPL.\nMaking the national team\nThe  IPL  has  enabled  many  an  Indian  player  to  get  noticed  and  subsequently  make  it  to  the  national\nteam  and  many  others  to  come  back  into  the  reckoning.  It  was  by  virtue  of  their  standout\nperformances in the first season of the IPL that Yusuf Pathan and Ravindra Jadeja caught the attention\nof the Indian selectors. Similarly, Irfan Pathan made a comeback to the national side by doing well in\nthe fourth IPL season and there are countless other examples.\nWhile I agree that IPL performances are important enough to open doors to the national team, I am\nsure that IPL performances should only be used as a reason to pick a player for the Twenty20 format\nor, in exceptional cases, for ODI cricket. Playing well in the IPL does not make a player good enough\nfor Test cricket, and arguably not fifty-over one-day cricket, for they require completely different skill\nsets.  For  those  formats,  selectors  should  continue  to  look  at  performances  in  the  Ranji  and  Duleep\ntrophies, the Irani Trophy and other domestic competitions.\nRewarding our past stars\nOne of the best legacies of the IPL is that it has allowed the BCCI to reward former cricketers who\nplayed for India at a time when there wasn’t much money on offer. While every player in the IPL is\nassured of a decent standard of living, many former Indian greats had to suffer hardship in old age. In\na  fantastic  gesture  during  the  fifth  season  of  the  IPL  in  May  2012,  the  BCCI  decided  to  use  the\nrevenues  generated  by  the  competition  to  reward  every  player  who  had  ever  played  for  India.  Even\ndomestic players who had played a certain number of first-class games were brought within the ambit\nof this scheme. Such a gesture serves as huge encouragement for aspiring cricketers, who know that if\nthey make the national team they will never have to worry about the basic necessities of life.\nIt  was  a  nice  touch  that  these  special  payments  were  presented  during  the  play-off  stages  of  the\ntournament in front of full stadiums, highlighting the achievements of these former servants of Indian\ncricket. This certainly wouldn’t have been possible without the IPL.\nApprehensions\nA major apprehension concerning the IPL is that its riches will make playing for India somewhat less\nsignificant and correspondingly less appealing. Many say that a lot of Indian youngsters are content to\nearn  substantial  sums  of  money  and  lead  a  good  life  playing  Twenty20.  For  me  personally  there  is\nnothing that compares to playing for India, but it depends on the individual: is he prepared to put in\nthe extra work required to play for his country, or is he satisfied with a couple of months of fame a\nyear? Someone who is determined to play for his country will inevitably strive towards his goal, while\nthose who aren’t motivated enough to do so don’t really deserve to don India colours.\nAnother concern is that the IPL might cause burn-out in Indian players. I don’t quite agree with this\nproposition. While I am not debating the need to control the number of Twenty20 games played each\nyear,  putting  all  the  blame  for  injuries  on  the  IPL  isn’t  always  correct.  The  best  players  from  all\ncountries play the IPL and every country, at the moment, has a similar schedule. Given the amount of\ncricket  being  played  around  the  world,  injuries  are  now  part  of  a  cricketer’s  life. Australian  players\nwho haven’t played the IPL have also been out for months injured, even though Australia has one of\nthe best injury-management programmes in the world. Most international cricketers play with niggles\nand ultimately players themselves are the best judges of their bodies, and they have to be sensible and\nresponsible when deciding whether to play or not.\nPlaying for the Mumbai Indians\nI  thoroughly  enjoyed  playing  for  the  Mumbai  Indians.  Just  after  the  IPL  was  launched  in  late  2007,\nMukesh Ambani, the owner, told me that he would like me to captain the team and I readily agreed.\nAs skipper, I made it very clear to my team-mates that all I wanted from them was total commitment\non the field, and that’s what we tried to do in my six seasons in the IPL.\nIt took some time to get used to how the auction worked. I was in Australia when the first one took\nplace  in  February  2008  and  had  provided  the  management  with  a  list  of  players  I  wanted  for  every\nposition; in fact, I had provided multiple options. But the team we ended up with didn’t have quite the\nbalance  I’d  hoped  for  and  our  first  season  wasn’t  particularly  successful.  It  also  didn’t  help  that  I\nwasn’t able to play the first seven games because of injury.\nHappily, one of the players we did manage to pick was Lasith Malinga. I was keen to have him at\nany cost as I was sure he would be a handy option for this format, and he has proved to be an excellent\nperformer in Twenty20. Mind you, no one bowls quite like Malinga. With his low, slingy action, it’s\nalmost as if the umpire becomes the sightscreen. I remember an occasion in Sri Lanka when Malinga\nwas bowling to me with a white ball and I had to ask the umpire to remove his white hat, because I\nwas losing the ball against it! Unfortunately for us, Malinga wasn’t able to play the entire first season\nowing to a knee injury.\nAfter  the  Mumbai  Indians  failed  to  make  the  semi-finals  in  the  first  two  seasons,  we  were\ndetermined to put in a better performance in 2010. Mrs Nita Ambani was personally involved from the\nbeginning of the season and this time we began our preparations weeks before the season started. We\nhad a two-day bonding camp at the Waterstones Club in Mumbai and enjoyed getting to know each\nother.  Mrs  Ambani  was  present  on  both  days  and  the  players  enjoyed  interacting  with  her.  The\nyoungsters  in  the  team  mixed  with  the  senior  players  and  I  remember  that  Zaheer  Khan,  Harbhajan\nand I were asked a series of questions by the other players about our careers and our lives as Indian\ncricketers.  It  was  interesting  to  learn  that  Zaheer  found  it  very  difficult  to  adjust  to  the  Mumbai\nlifestyle  after  coming  from  the  relatively  smaller  town  of  Ahmednagar  and  I  was  particularly\nfascinated  by  Harbhajan’s  stories  about  his  childhood  while  growing  up  in  Punjab.  We  played  a\nvariety of sports, including table tennis, squash and water polo, but no cricket.\nThe camp worked brilliantly and that season we finally did ourselves justice and were the team to\nbeat throughout the competition. Unfortunately, I got injured while catching a ball in the slips in the\nsemi-final, splitting the webbing between my fingers on my right hand. I had to have six stitches and\ncouldn’t  hold  the  bat  properly  and  most  people  who  saw  the  injury  felt  I  wouldn’t  make  the  final\nagainst the Chennai Super Kings, led by MS Dhoni. I was determined to take part, however.\nOn the morning of the final I tried having an injection to numb the injured area, which I thought\nwould help me hold the bat. I had also had some special gloves made, with added protection for the\ninjury, but it seemed that the pain was going to be too much. However, the plan did not work as well\nas I’d hoped and after the area was numbed I found I had no idea where my fingers were. I actually\nwent  back  to  the  hotel,  disappointed  that  even  after  having  the  excruciatingly  painful  injection  the\nsituation  had  not  improved.  In  the  end,  though,  I  managed  to  play  in  the  final,  despite  being  in\nconsiderable  pain.  In  the  gap  between  the  semi-final  and  the  final  I  had  also  visited  a  doctor  in  Sri\nLanka,  who  said  he  could  get  me  ready  for  the  final  and  that  I  would  have  to  take  the  medicine  he\nprescribed  twice  a  day.  However,  as  a  side  effect  I  would  not  be  able  to  sleep  properly  for  the  first\nthree days, but once the medicine had run its course I would sleep a lot. He was right. The medicine\ndid help and I did eventually play in the final – but, as warned, I wasn’t able to sleep for three nights\nand then slept for three days!\nIn the warm-up before the match, the umpires walked up to me to check that I was aware of what I\nwas  getting  into:  because  I  was  carrying  an  injury  suffered  before  the  game  started,  I  would  not  be\nallowed a substitute. But I had considered all the consequences and was ready to pull myself through\nthe pain to try and win the coveted IPL trophy.\nTwice in the match the ball hit my injured hand. The first time was when I was fielding at fine leg.\nOn the second occasion I was standing at cover when Suresh Raina, the left-handed middle-order bat,\nplayed  a  full-blooded  cover  drive  that  came  to  me  in  a  flash.  I  instinctively  stopped  the  ball  and\nrealized  soon  afterwards  that  my  stitches  had  burst.  At  the  changeover  my  hand  was  bleeding.  I\nignored it and went out to bat wearing the special gloves, which had no gap between the middle and\nindex  fingers.  Wearing  these,  I  could  at  least  get  a  grip  on  the  bat,  and  I  managed  to  make  48.\nUnfortunately for us, the IPL trophy continued to elude us as we lost too many wickets in a heap and\nfell 22 runs short of the target.\nA lot was written about the decision to bat Kieron Pollard at number seven during the run chase in\nthat 2010 final. It was a decision taken by the management based on my input and the reasoning was\nclear.  As  long  as  the  spinners  were  bowling,  we  wanted  the  likes  of  Ambati  Rayudu  and  Saurabh\nTiwary, both of whom were good players of spin, to be out in the middle. Pollard could then come in\nand  take  on  the  faster  bowlers.  In  hindsight,  however,  I  believe  that  sending  Pollard  up  the  order\nwould have been the better option. It was a mistake and I have no hesitation in admitting it.\nWe had another good competition the following season and made the play-offs again. I got my first\nand  only  Twenty20  hundred  against  the  Kochi  Tuskers  team.  In  fact,  in  those  two  seasons,  I  was\nconsistent  at  the  top  of  the  order  and  there  was  talk  about  me  playing  for  the  Indian  team  for  the\nWorld Twenty20 in the Caribbean in April–May 2010. However, the thought never crossed my mind.\nBy early 2010 the Indian Twenty20 team had a settled look to it and it would not have been right to\nreconsider my decision not to play international Twenty20 cricket for just one tournament.\nI  thoroughly  enjoyed  my  experiences  in  Twenty20  with  the  Mumbai  Indians.  The  overwhelming\nsense of positivity that surrounds the team made playing for them a real pleasure. I also enjoyed being\ncaptain in the first four seasons, but I am glad that I then handed over the captaincy to Harbhajan, a\ndecision that caused a stir in the media at the time. The fact was that 2011–12 was one of my toughest\nyears in cricket and by the time of the fifth season of the IPL, which started on 4 April 2012, I was\nfeeling mentally drained. I was in no position to cope with the stress of captaincy and just wanted to\ncontinue as a batsman. It was for this reason that I asked the owners to consider giving the captaincy\nto Harbhajan. I would be there to help and offer advice to him on and off the field, especially because\nhe and I had always shared a great camaraderie while playing for India.\nI  have  known  Bhajji  since  1994,  when  he  first  bowled  a  few  doosras  to  me  during  practice  in\nChandigarh, and we became very good friends when he broke into the Indian team against Australia in\nBangalore  in  1998.  Bhajji  had  already  shown  his  mettle  as  captain  of  the  Mumbai  Indians  in  the\nChampions League Twenty20 in October 2011, which I missed through injury, when he did brilliantly\nto lead the team to the title.\nThe final season\nI knew that 2013 was always going to be my last year in the IPL. Dedicating three more years to the\nIPL as a player after I turned 40 in April 2013 was never an option. I was desperate to win the title,\nhaving  come  so  close  in  2010.  We  had  a  good  unit  and  all  the  players  were  fit  going  into  the\ntournament. Ricky Ponting was now captain, John Wright was coach, and Anil Kumble had joined us\nas mentor, making it a very strong support unit.\nI started the season with a disappointing run-out but batted well from the middle of the tournament.\nRicky, however, was not in the best of form and he decided to drop himself for a few games and hand\nthe captaincy to Rohit, who was batting well. Rohit did a very good job as skipper and the bowling too\ncame  together  nicely,  with  Malinga,  Mitchell  Johnson,  Harbhajan  and  Pragyan  Ojha  consistently\ndoing well for us. But just when my own form was peaking, I sustained the injury that brought my IPL\ncareer to an end.\nWe were playing the Sunrisers Hyderabad on 13 May 2013 and were in control, having scored 91\noff twelve overs, with the loss of just one wicket. The asking rate was slightly over ten runs an over\nand with nine wickets in hand we had every reason to feel confident. I was starting to accelerate and\nhit the first ball of the thirteenth over for six over long on. Just as I was completing the shot, I heard a\nclick in my left hand and then felt excruciating pain. I immediately called for the physio, but massage\ndidn’t do any good. I was finding it impossible to hold the bat, let alone play a shot. It was a critical\ntime in the match and there was no way I could keep playing on and waste balls in the process. The\nonly option was to retire hurt.\nI  had  a  series  of  scans,  which  showed  inflammation  of  the  tendons  and  fluid  accumulation  in  the\nhand. The doctors said it would take a minimum of three weeks to heal and it was clear my campaign\nwas over. Though I wasn’t able to play, I decided to travel with the team. I bowled long stints in the\nnets and did what I could to help the boys with their preparation. It was hard to sit out for the final,\nthough, particularly because I was getting into a good rhythm, but it was an incredible feeling when\nthe Mumbai Indians won the 2013 IPL trophy in front of a packed Eden Gardens crowd in Kolkata. To\ncap it all, my team-mates very kindly said that the triumph was for me.\nIt was during the final that I was asked in an interview if I would play the first game of the next IPL\nseason in front of my home crowd at the Wankhede. It was clear to me that I would not be able to and\nI  found  myself  saying  so.  I  hadn’t  actually  planned  to  announce  my  retirement  from  the  IPL  and  it\nhappened on the spur of the moment. Anjali was at the ground and a number of journalists went on to\nask her what she thought of me announcing my retirement from the IPL. She was a little taken aback\nat what I’d said, though she knew very well that season six was going to be my last.\nWhile I was very sorry not to play for Mumbai in the last five games of IPL season six, I will look\nback with fondness at my IPL career, which came to an end with me hitting a six off the last ball I\nfaced!\nPlay-off stage\nQualifier 1.

            "title": "NUMBER ONE\n",
            "data": "Having beaten Australia 2–0 at home in October–November 2008, we were optimistic about the home\nseries against England in December. Gary Kirsten, our coach, had instilled a sense of confidence in the\nplayers  and  all  we  needed  to  do  now  was  sustain  the  momentum  after  the  retirements  of Anil  and\nSourav, two of the best players to represent India.\nEngland in India, December 2008\nEngland’s tour started with a seven-match series of ODIs. I did not play in the first three because I\nwas suffering from another elbow problem, this time what is known as a ‘golfer’s elbow’. It troubled\nme throughout the season, but not enough to miss a Test match, and it actually turned out to be one of\nthe best seasons of my career. My good form extended into the next season, and I was nominated the\nICC’s Cricketer of the Year for 2009–10.\nAfter making only 11 in my comeback match in Bangalore, I was more satisfied with a fifty in the\nfifth game at Cuttack on 26 November, which we won comfortably, taking a 5–0 series lead. Shortly\nafter the game we heard that some sort of gang war had started in Mumbai. We were deeply perturbed\nby what we saw on the news channels in the dressing room. It was obviously much more than a gang\nwar and the live footage left us shocked. Our thoughts and prayers went out to the people who were\ncaught up in the catastrophe.\nMost of the players watched what was happening on television till late into the night and it became\nclear  to  us  that  India  was  essentially  under  attack.  It  was  the  most  barbaric  of  acts  and  what  was\nhappening  in  the  streets  of  Mumbai  was  shocking.  These  were  places  that  were  part  of  our  daily\nexistence. It was devastating to see flames coming out of the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, one of India’s\niconic landmarks. I anxiously called Anjali to check that she and all our friends and loved ones were\nsafe.\nWhat  made  it  all  even  more  personal  was  that,  just  the  day  before, Anjali  had  been  in  Leopold’s\nrestaurant,  which  was  one  of  the  prime  targets,  and  had  also  visited  another  target,  the  Oberoi,  for\ndinner the previous night. She had gone to see a play at the National Centre for the Performing Arts\nand  ended  up  having  dinner  with  her  friends  there.  She  could  so  easily  have  been  caught  up  in  the\nmayhem.\nThe  terror  attack  continued  the  next  morning  and  the  pictures  were  beamed  live  all  day  on  27\nNovember 2008. We had a team meeting and were informed that England had decided to call off the\nseries  and  had  already  left  for  Dubai.  It  was  understandable,  because  none  of  us  was  in  a  frame  of\nmind  to  play  cricket.  I  returned  to  Mumbai  that  evening  and  was  met  by  security  personnel  at  the\nairport, who escorted me home. It was unnerving to think that it was all happening so close to where I\nlived. I was angry and upset and it was a horrible feeling having to sit back and pray for the ordeal to\nend.\nA  week  after  the  terror  attacks,  it  was  announced  that  England  were  coming  back  for  a  two-Test\nseries. This was a terrific gesture and each one of us appreciated the efforts of the English to return to\nIndia within two weeks of the carnage. While nothing could compensate for the trauma inflicted by\nthese terror strikes, a resumption of cricket was a welcome sign for us all.\nCricket for peace\nWhen we assembled in Chennai for the first Test on 11 December we were still finding it difficult to\nconcentrate  on  cricket.  Our  thoughts  were  with  the  victims  of  the  attacks  and  everyone  was  talking\nabout those traumatic three days. But we had a Test match on our hands and we felt it was important\nfor all our fans that we should put in a good peformance in Chennai.\nEngland  started  well,  with  captain Andrew  Strauss  becoming  the  first  England  player  to  make  a\ncentury in both innings on the subcontinent and Paul Collingwood also making a century. Unless we\nmanaged to pull things back on the morning of day four, it was going to be difficult to save the match.\nZaheer and Ishant bowled very well in the English second innings but it was Zaheer’s spell of three\nwickets in five overs, including the centurion Collingwood, that brought us back into the game. For\nthe first time we sensed we had the opposition on the back foot and it was now up to the batsmen to\nchase down the target of 387. It would not be easy – in fact it would be the highest ever run chase on\nIndian soil – but under Gary we had started to believe that anything was possible.\nSehwag  set  up  the  match  wonderfully  by  scoring  a  brilliant  counter-attacking  83  on  the  fourth\nevening. It was an innings of outstanding ability. I went in to bat on the morning of the final day and\nfor the first hour or so just tried to soak up the pressure. Once we had weathered the early storm we\nstarted to look for runs. Every positive stroke put the pressure back on England and slowly but steadily\nthe balance started to tilt in our favour.\nLaxman and I had a good partnership and once Laxman fell, Yuvraj joined me in the middle. I was\ndetermined  to  bat  till  the  end  of  the  match.  Indians  love  cricket  and  if,  for  just  a  minute  or  two,  a\nvictory in Chennai could lift their mood after everything that had happened, I would feel humbled.\nYuvraj batted well under pressure, making 85. There was a time in his innings when he attempted to\nplay the reverse sweep to Monty Panesar and I walked up to him to tell him that all he needed to do\nwas remain not out and finish the game. I reminded him of the Pakistan game at Chennai in 1999 and\nsaid I had been in a similar position before and remembered well how painful it was to lose from a\nwinning  position. Yuvraj  reined  himself  in  and  we  finally  reached  our  target  in  the  last  hour  of  the\nfifth day. I had scored an unbeaten hundred for the team, but it was the extra significance of the game\nthat made it particularly gratifying. In a first in Indian cricket, even the groundswomen, who hardly\never came to the foreground, celebrated the victory with great vigour. As we were walking back to the\nchanging rooms, I was asked who I planned to dedicate the hundred to. I had not thought about it and\nwas still very much in the moment, but on behalf of the team I dedicated the victory to the victims of\nthe terrorist attack.\nIndia in New Zealand, one-day series, March 2009\nWe  followed  up  the  victory  at  Chennai  with  a  well-played  draw  at  Mohali  and  won  the  series  1–0.\nBack-to-back series wins at home was an excellent way to cap off the year and we were all looking\nforward to our next away series in New Zealand.\nBeating  the  Black  Caps  in  New  Zealand  can  be  a  tricky  task,  but  we  knew  we  had  a  great\nopportunity. We were in good form and seemed to have developed the useful ability to pull ourselves\nout of difficult situations; if one person failed, the second would step up.\nIn the five-match one-day series, we easily won the rain-affected first match, thanks largely to the\nbatting of Sehwag and Dhoni. The second match was a washout, but in the third match at Christchurch,\none of the smaller grounds, I had reached 163 when I was forced to retire hurt with a strained stomach\nmuscle in the forty-fifth over.\nIt was frustrating to have to go off in that kind of form. I like to think I was in with a chance of\nscoring a double hundred had I been able to bat on, and I wasn’t alone in thinking that. As soon as I\nentered  the  dressing  room,  Sehwag  walked  up  to  me,  saying,  ‘Paaji  yeh  apne  kya  kar  diya.  Double\nhundred ka chance tha.’ (What have you done, brother? You had a realistic chance of scoring a double\nhundred.)  I  laughed  and  said  to  him,  ‘Arre  main  mar  hi  nahi  pa  raha  hoon,  double  hundred  kaise\nbanaunga. Pitch achha hain aur hame abhi runs chaiye. Double hundred kabhi na kabhi ho jayga.’ (I\ncan’t even hit the ball, so how can I score a double hundred? It is a good pitch to bat on and we need\nbig runs at the moment. I will score a double hundred at some point in the future.’) Sehwag, however,\nwouldn’t  let  up  and  said,  ‘Arre  woh  toh  doosra  double  hundred  hoga,  aaj  ka  to  aaj  karna  chaihiye\ntha!’  (When  you  score  a  double  hundred  again  it  might  be  the second  double  hundred.  Today  you\nshould have scored the first ever ODI double ton!)\nThe match was a high-scoring one and, despite setting a target of 392, with Yuvraj Singh and Dhoni\nboth  making  half-centuries,  we  were  not  safe.  New  Zealand  played  well  to  get  to  334,  thanks  in  no\nsmall  part  to  an  opening  partnership  of  166  between  Brendon  McCullum  and  Jesse  Ryder,  and  the\naggregate score of 726 in the two innings was the second highest in the history of ODI cricket.\nI missed the next match at Hamilton, which we also won thanks to an onslaught from Sehwag that\nbrought  him  125.  To  celebrate  taking  a  3–0  lead  in  the  series,  Bhajji,  Zaheer, Yuvi  and  I  met  up  in\nBhajji’s  room  for  dinner,  which  was  next  to  the  health  club  in  the  hotel.  There  was  a  wonderful\noutdoor  Jacuzzi  and  it  had  started  drizzling  outside,  making  it  a  beautiful  setting.  While  my  team-\nmates wanted to get into the Jacuzzi, I said I was content to stay where I was. Seeing my reluctance,\nthe three of them hatched a plot.\nWe had ordered food in the room and were chatting while we waited for it when they grabbed me\nfrom behind and hurled me into the water. I was screaming at them, saying my watch would get spoilt,\nbut it made no difference, as they were determined to have fun at my expense. They all followed me\ninto the Jacuzzi and we started messing around in the water. By now the food had arrived and within\nminutes  the  French  fries,  sandwiches  and  ketchup  had  found  their  way  into  the  Jacuzzi.  It  was\ncertainly an unusual way to celebrate!\nIndia in New Zealand, Test series, March–April 2009\nIn the first Test at Hamilton, which started on 18 March, New Zealand batted first and made 279, with\nDaniel  Vettori  scoring  a  hundred.  I  still  jokingly  tell  our  bowlers  whenever  I  see  them,  ‘ Arre  usko\nkaise hundred marne diya tha yaar tumlog?’ (How could you allow him to score a hundred?) He did\nplay well, though, and took some calculated risks that paid off.\nWhen I went in to bat in the afternoon of day two, I couldn’t time the ball to save my life. I just\ndidn’t feel comfortable, so I decided to change my stance. This was something I used to try from time\nto  time  and  it  often  did  the  trick.  Normally  I  bat  with  a  side-on  stance,  but  in  Hamilton  I  opened\nmyself  up  slightly  and  also  increased  the  gap  between  my  feet  a  little.  The  umpire  Simon  Taufel\nnoticed  the  difference  and  mentioned  to  me  that  I  looked  a  completely  different  batsman  after  the\ndrinks break and asked what I had done to myself. Sometimes such tiny adjustments can make a big\ndifference.\nTowards  the  end  of  the  first  day,  the  light  dropped  appreciably  and  Iain  O’Brien,  New  Zealand’s\nbest  bowler  in  the  series,  was  bowling  from  one  end.  The  umpires  were  reluctant  to  stop  the  game,\nwhich I thought was unfair because it was a crucial time in the match and there was no chance of the\nlight  improving.  I  somehow  managed  to  survive,  though,  and  was  unbeaten  on  70  at  the  end  of  the\nsecond  day.  The  next  morning  I  got  off  to  an  aggressive  start.  My  knock  of  160  contributed  to  a\nsizeable first-innings lead, alongside fifties from Gambhir, Dravid and Zaheer Khan. Our bowlers, led\nby Bhajji with six wickets, delivered once again to set up a very satisfying win.\nUnfortunately, I missed the latter parts of the match because I was injured in the very first over of\nthe New Zealand second innings when I dived forward to take a catch at slip off Zaheer’s bowling. The\nedge from Tim McIntosh had come low and as I tried to get my fingers under the ball I damaged the\nindex  finger  of  my  left  hand.  I  had  to  be  taken  to  hospital  to  have  the  injury  checked  and  X-rays\nrevealed I had a fracture.\nThere wasn’t much time before the second Test at Napier but the early end of the first one at least\ngave me an extra day to recover. To protect the finger, I tried putting three finger caps one on top of\nthe other and also applied a fibre plaster, which I moulded by putting it in hot water, topped off with a\nlot of padding. With all that protection, I had little sense of where my finger actually was, but in the\nend I decided I could last a Test as long as I stood in a relatively quiet fielding position.\nThis  time  it  worked  out  well  and  I  managed  to  score  runs  in  both  innings  of  the  second  Test  at\nNapier. New Zealand scored 619 in their first innings, with Jesse Ryder following up his 102 in the\nfirst Test with a double century, supported by hundreds from Ross Taylor and Brendon McCullum. We\nhad to bat out a little more than two days to save the match. We had a brief team meeting ahead of the\nsecond innings and there was a strong belief that we could do it. Gary had a big role to play in this and\nexuded a kind of quiet confidence, which in turn had a positive impact on the team.\nGautam Gambhir batted superbly in the second innings and thanks to his magnificent 137 we saved\nthe  match  comfortably  in  the  end.  He  batted  for  ten  and  a  half  hours  and  played  436  balls  in  an\nexemplary display of patience and character. Laxman also scored a hundred and the draw was a true\nreflection of the team’s mind-set at the time: we were relishing the challenges set before us.\nIn the third Test in Wellington, we scored a reasonable 379, batting first, but then Zaheer Khan and\nHarbhajan Singh combined to bowl out New Zealand for 197, giving us a 182-run lead. In our second\ninnings, a magnificent 167 from Gambhir helped set New Zealand a target of 717.\nWe picked up four wickets on day four and had the whole of the fifth day to take the remaining six\nwickets to wrap up the series 2–0. Zaheer, Ishant and Munaf Patel were bowling extremely well for us,\nas they had right through the series. The plan was to bowl short and attack the shoulder/ribcage area in\nan attempt to rattle the opposition. It seemed to work and I could sense the discomfort in some of the\nNew Zealand batsmen.\nWith the wind behind him, Ishant was unplayable at times. Munaf took on the challenging job of\nbowling  into  the  wind  and  for  those  who  are  not  aware  of  the  difficulties  involved,  the  wind  at\nWellington  can  reduce  your  pace  by  at  least  10  kph.  Batsmen  have  to  be  able  to  make  subtle\nadjustments to adapt to conditions like these. One problem with looking into strong winds is that you\ncan’t keep your eyes open for too long at a stretch. Also, when facing someone bowling with the wind,\nyour bat speed has to be slightly faster than normal because the ball hurries on quicker than expected.\nOn  the  other  hand,  a  batsman  can  put  pressure  on  someone  bowling  into  the  wind  because  the  bat\nswing is naturally faster with the wind behind you.\nOn this occasion, our bowlers made sure the New Zealand batsmen were never at ease and despite\nanother century from Ross Taylor in the second innings, we were always in control. Jesse Ryder, who\nhad  been  their  most  successful  batsman  in  the  series,  failed  in  both  innings  at  Wellington,  which\ndefinitely helped our chances. I was given the ball a little before lunch on day five and was pleased to\nget  the  crucial  wicket  of  Brendon  McCullum,  caught  at  slip  for  6.  Then  I  could  tell  that  James\nFranklin, the last recognized batsman, wasn’t picking my googlies and was trying to sweep every ball\nto  negate  the  overspin.  I  asked  Dhoni  to  take  the  fielder  away  from  point  and  place  two  fielders  at\nshort square leg. This would stop Franklin from playing the sweep shot and would force him to cut.\nThe plan worked and I had Franklin lbw soon after making the field change.\nWe would have won the match if Ishant had held on to a chance from Iain O’Brien in the deep. The\nspilled  catch  allowed  New  Zealand  a  lifeline  before  the  heavens  opened  after  lunch,  bringing  a\npremature end to the match. Close to two sessions of play were lost to rain and we missed out on a\ngolden opportunity.\nAn  incident  from  this  New  Zealand  series  gives  an  idea  of  how  much  difference  local  conditions\ncan  make  to  a  team’s  chances.  It  happened  at  Christchurch  during  the  ODI  series  when  Zaheer  was\nbowling.  He  had  bowled  a  good-length  ball  and  the  batsman’s  attempted  front-foot  slog  over\nmidwicket turned into a top edge. Zaheer screamed out ‘MINE!’ and carefully positioned himself for\nthe catch. To his dismay, the wind got hold of the ball and it landed at least fifteen feet away. Later we\nall joked with him, saying, ‘So the catch was yours, was it, Zak?’\nAiming for the top\nOur  rise  up  the  ICC  Test  rankings  had  started  in  England  back  in  2007.  Now,  after  the  successful\nseries in New Zealand, we had the opportunity to take the number-one position if we beat Sri Lanka at\nhome in November–December 2009.\nThe  series  against  Sri  Lanka  was  also  special  for  personal  reasons,  because  I  notched  up  twenty\nyears in international cricket in November 2009. I celebrated the occasion by speaking to the media\nfor more than seven hours, giving close to fifty one-on-one interviews. So much for people saying I\ndid  not  talk  to  the  media  enough!  Looking  back  at  how  uncomfortable  I  was  at  my  first  press\nconference in 1990, I had indeed come a long way.\nI remember being confronted with a camera for the first time as an awkward teenager. In my early\nTV advertisements, I was not what you might call camera-friendly. I was self-conscious about using\nmake-up and insisted on being natural, with nothing on my face and nothing done to my hair. It was\nonly later that I realized that it was just a normal part of working with cameras. Later in my career, I\nreally enjoyed shooting commercials and there were some incidents that I can never forget.\nOn one occasion I was at a shoot with one of India’s greatest cinema icons, Amitabh Bachchan, in\nthe Rajasthan city of Jodhpur. While we were taking a break, I suddenly realized that Arjun, who was\nonly a toddler then, had finished his meal and was happily wiping his hands on Amitabh Bachchan’s\nchuridar (the lower garment we wear in India with a kurta). Anjali and I were both mortified, but he\nkindly kept telling us that it was perfectly all right and that a child of Arjun’s age hardly knew what he\nwas  doing.  While  Mr  Bachchan  was  looking  at  the  funnier  side  of  the  incident,  as  parents  we  were\nextremely embarrassed by it. I even said to him that ‘Arjun jabh bada ho jayega to es incident ko yaad\nkarke  sharmaega.’  (When  Arjun  grows  up  he  will  remember  what  he  did  and  feel  seriously\nembarrassed.) His conduct during this episode only added to my respect for the great man.\nAnother commercial I have fond memories of involved another Bollywood legend, Shahrukh Khan.\nShahrukh and I were shooting for Pepsi at Lord’s on the eve of the 1999 World Cup and the plan was\nfor Shahrukh to pose as me and open the refrigerator in the dressing room to take out a chilled Pepsi.\nThat’s when I was supposed to confront him for impersonating me. I ended up adding my own ideas to\nthe  commercial  and  said  we  should  not  stop  there,  but  I  should  take  the  Pepsi  bottle  from  him  and\nforce him to go out and bat in my place as well. The director loved the idea and the script was changed\non the day.\nSri Lanka don’t make it easy\nBefore  the  first  Test  of  the  three-match  series  started  in  Ahmedabad  on  16  November,  Anjali  had\nplanned something special for me, to mark my twenty years in international cricket. As a surprise, she\nand  a  few  of  my  closest  friends  hired  a  private  jet  and  flew  into Ahmedabad  on  the  morning  of  the\ngame. I was having breakfast with MS Dhoni and had my back to the restaurant door when I saw in\nDhoni’s  eyes  that  something  was  going  on  behind  me.  Even  before  I  could  turn  to  see  what  was\nhappening, Anjali and the gang had reached me. It was totally unexpected and I was deeply touched by\nthe gesture.\nHalfway through the Test, we found ourselves in a spot of bother. Centuries from Dravid and Dhoni\nhad  helped  us  to  a  decent  first-innings  total  of  426,  but  Sri  Lanka  had  scored  760  runs  in  response,\nthanks  to  hundreds  from  Dilshan  and  Prasanna  Jayawardene  and  a  double  hundred  from  Mahela\nJayawardene. We now needed to bat for a day and a half to save the game. But our never-say-die spirit\ncame to the fore again and we batted exceptionally well to draw the match, with the opener Gambhir\nsetting the foundation with 114.\nI  also  scored  a  hundred  on  the  last  day  and  it  was  not  a  century  free  of  incidents.  Once  it  was\nevident to the Sri Lankans that they could no longer win, they set ultra-defensive fields. At one point\nKumar Sangakkara, the Sri Lankan skipper, asked if I really wanted to carry on because there was no\nlonger  a  possibility  of  a  result  in  the  match.  I  said  to  him  bluntly  that  a  Test  hundred  was  a  Test\nhundred and I would have got there long before if he had set sporting fields. While I had no problem\nwith him trying to make things difficult for me, there was no reason for me to call it off when there\nwas time left in the game.\nAt  this,  Sangakkara  set  a  7–2  off-side  field  and  must  have  asked  his  left-arm  fast  bowler\nWelegedara to bowl to me a couple of feet outside my off stump with the ball going further away. I\nfelt  the  need  to  improvise  and  on  one  occasion  moved  almost  two  feet  outside  the  off  stump  and\nflicked  Welegedara  to  square  leg  for  four  to  get  into  the  nineties.  When  I  eventually  reached  my\ncentury, I asked Sangakkara if he wanted to continue the game. I was happy to carry on batting, but\nthen we both decided to call off the game.\nThere was a similar situation in the same series during the third ODI in Cuttack on 21 December\n2009.  Chasing  the  Sri  Lankan  total  of  239,  I  was  in  the  nineties  and  Dinesh  Karthik  was  giving  me\nvery good support at the other end. With only a few runs needed to win, Sangakkara decided to place\nmost of his fielders on the boundary when I was facing, while for Dinesh he would bring the field right\nin. To counter the ploy, Dinesh played a number of dot-balls before I intervened and asked him just to\nfinish  the  match.  The  win,  I  said,  was  far  more  important  than  my  hundred.  In  the  end,  I  remained\nunbeaten on 96 as Dinesh hit the winning runs.\nI’m also reminded of what the Sri Lankans did against Virender Sehwag on 16 August 2010 during\na one-day international in Dambulla. With Viru on 99 and only one run needed, the off-spinner Suraj\nRandiv  bowled  a  big  no-ball  and  even  though  Viru  hit  him  for  six,  the  runs  did  not  count  because\ntechnically the match was over the moment the no-ball was bowled. Viru fell short of the hundred by\none run and the incident created quite a storm in the media at the time.\nNumber one at last\nAfter  the  hard-fought  draw  in  the  first  Test,  we  routed  the  Sri  Lankans  in  the  next  Test  at  Kanpur,\nwhich started on 24 November 2009. Our first three batsmen, Gautam Gambhir, Virender Sehwag and\nRahul Dravid, all got hundreds and the bowlers backed them up with some disciplined bowling, so that\nwe won by an innings and 144 runs. The series had been set up beautifully for a grand finale at the CCI\nin Mumbai the following week.\nAt the CCI, Virender Sehwag produced one of the best Test innings I have seen. He played some\nbreathtaking shots and scored 284 not out in a single day of cricket. He fell the next morning for 293,\nnarrowly missing out on the third triple ton of his career. The pace at which he scored also allowed our\nbowlers  plenty  of  time  to  bowl  out  the  opposition.  In  that  sort  of  form,  he  could  demoralize  any\nbowling attack in the world and in a way he helped change approaches to opening the batting in Test\ncricket. Zaheer did the rest of the job in style, picking up a five-for in the Sri Lankan second innings,\nand we won the match by an innings and 24 runs. It was a tremendous victory – and it meant that we\nwere now officially the number-one Test team.\nA more personal high point in this match was running out Angelo Mathews for 99 in the Sri Lankan\nfirst innings. He played the ball to fine leg and turned for a second run in a bid to get to his century. I\nmanaged to get to the ball quickly and sent in a flat powerful throw, which landed right on top of the\nstumps. All Dhoni had to do was knock off the bails. While celebrating the dismissal I joked with my\nteam-mates that the old man could still field even after playing international cricket for twenty long\nyears!\nWe had played terrific cricket as a team. Each and every player had chipped in and Gary and the\nsupport staff – Paddy Upton, our high-performance and mental-conditioning coach; Ramji Srinivasan,\nour  fitness  trainer;  Nitin  Patel,  our  physio;  Ramesh  Mane  and  Amit  Shah,  our  masseurs;  and\nDhananjay, our computer analyst – had all played important roles in our rise to the top. For me, Test\ncricket is the format that matters the most and this was undoubtedly a high point in my career. The\nfact  that  it  coincided  with  my  twentieth  anniversary  in  international  cricket  had  made  it  even  more\nspecial.\nEngland in India 2008\n1st Test.

            "title": "STAYING AT THE TOP\n",
            "data": "In  2010,  we  faced  three  of  the  toughest  assignments  in  international  cricket  and  to  maintain  our\nnumber-one  position  we  needed  to  do  well  in  all  of  them.  We  had  to  play  South Africa  at  home  in\nFebruary–March, Australia at home in October and New Zealand at home in November, before finally\ntravelling to South Africa in December.\nBefore  all  these,  however,  we  went  to  Bangladesh  for  a  two-Test  series  in  January  2010.  While\nmany  feel  Bangladesh  are  a  pushover,  they  have  surprised  many  a  good  side  in  the  past  and  you\nunderestimate them at your peril. This was evident in the first Test at Chittagong, which started on 17\nJanuary, where we were reduced to 209–8 in the first innings. The crowd was behind the local team\nand  batting  was  a  serious  challenge  against  an  inspired  bowling  attack,  with  Shahadat  Hossain  and\nShakib-Al-Hasan  both  finally  taking  five  wickets.  Every  wicket  was  greeted  with  a  loud  cheer  and\nevery boundary with pin-drop silence.\nIt  was  interesting  to  bat  in  front  of  such  a  partisan  crowd.  I  scored  105  not  out  and  we  somehow\nmanaged to post a score of 243. Our bowlers did well to restrict Bangladesh in their first innings to\none run less than our total, then Gambhir scored a century in our second innings, helping us to 413.\nDespite a century from Mushfiqur Rahim, the 415-run target proved too much for Bangladesh and we\nended up winning by 113 runs.\nIn the second Test at Dhaka a few days later, where it was hot and sultry after the haze and chill in\nChittagong, our fast bowlers again delivered in difficult conditions, with Zaheer bowling at his best in\nthe  second  innings,  getting  an  incredible  amount  of  reverse  swing  to  take  seven  wickets.  We  had\nbatted  well  in  our  first  and  only  innings,  making  544,  and  Rahul  and  I  scored  centuries,  setting  the\nmatch up for Zaheer.\nSouth Africa in India, February 2010\nWe reassembled to take on the South Africans in the first of two Tests at Nagpur on 6 February. The\npoints situation meant that whoever won the series would be the number-one Test team.\nIn  the  first  Test,  Dale  Steyn  bowled  brilliantly,  ending  up  with  ten  wickets,  and  we  were\ncomprehensively  beaten.  Hashim Amla,  with  253,  and  Jacques  Kallis,  with  173,  batted  superbly  for\nSouth Africa and Amla was in extraordinary batting form right through the series. Kallis has always\nbeen a champion performer and is undoubtedly the best all-round cricketer of our generation. It has\nbeen a pleasure competing with players like these, who will surely be remembered as all-time greats.\nThough we lost the game, I did manage to make a hundred in the second innings and I liked to think\nthat my plan against Dale Steyn had started to work. He is an exceptional fast bowler and we knew we\nwould  need  to  play  him  well  to  make  a  comeback  in  the  second  Test,  so  the  second-innings  batting\neffort  gave  us  a  little  hope  in  this  regard.  On  the  other  hand,  we  had  to  accept  that  we  had  made  it\ndifficult for ourselves and were going to have to play out of our skins to retain our number-one Test\nranking.\nWe  were  surprised  to  see  a  green  top  awaiting  us  at  Eden  Gardens.  It  had  all  but  nullified  the\nconcept of home advantage, but there was nothing we could do about the pitch at that stage.\nAgain South Africa started well, but then we staged a miraculous comeback towards the end of the\nfirst day. From a position of strength at 218–1, South Africa collapsed to a modest 296 all out thanks\nto  some  terrific  bowling  from  Zaheer  and  Harbhajan.  We  sensed  we  were  in  with  a  chance  and  put\ntogether a big first-innings total, with as many as four of us – Sehwag, Laxman, Dhoni and myself –\ngetting hundreds. Sehwag and I had a terrific partnership of 249 after losing two quick wickets and we\nalso  scored  at  a  phenomenal  pace,  unsettling  the  South  Africans.  Anything  on  middle-and-leg  was\nflicked  to  the  on  side,  while  anything  outside  off  stump  was  cut  or  driven.  It  was  a  dominant\npartnership and swung the pendulum in our favour.\nLaxman and Dhoni built on the platform and we finally declared at a whopping 643–6, leaving the\nSouth Africans two whole days to bat to save the game. Unfortunately for us, the weather intervened\non day four and a lot of overs were lost. By the end of the day South Africa had lost three wickets and\nwe still needed seven wickets to close out the match.\nThe  final  day  at  Eden  Gardens  was  Test  cricket  at  its  very  best.  Bhajji,  who  has  a  phenomenal\nrecord in Kolkata, bowled superbly, finishing with eight wickets in the match, and we took the final\nSouth African wicket with just a few overs remaining. The Eden Gardens crowd was behind us and the\nlast wicket, Morne Morkel lbw to Bhajji, was greeted with a deafening roar. Bhajji ran almost half the\nlength  of  the  ground  in  delight  and  we  were  thrilled  to  have  pulled  off  a  stunning  victory.  We  had\nretained our number-one ranking in the process and I felt all the more satisfied to think that, although\nmy first hundred didn’t save the first Test, my second one did contribute to our win in the second Test.\nIn the three-match one-day series that followed I was run out for four in the first game at Jaipur on\n21  February.  I  was  disappointed  with  the  dismissal  but  was  pleased  that  I  managed  to  make  a\ncontribution in the last over of the game, when the South Africans needed just ten runs to win. Dale\nSteyn and Wayne Parnell had staged a fantastic fightback after being reduced to 225–8 chasing 299,\nand  though  Praveen  Kumar  picked  up  Steyn  with  the  first  ball  of  his  final  over,  the  South Africans\nwere within striking distance of the total. The last man, Charl Langeveldt, hit the third ball of the over\npast short fine leg and at long leg I dived full length to save what was a certain boundary. The umpires\nconsulted the third umpire before finally ruling it a legal save. This made the difference in the end,\nwith India winning the match by one run.\nBy the time of the second match, in Gwalior on 24 February, I was starting to feel really tired. It\nhad been a long season and my body was beginning to raise some objections. I had aches and pains\neverywhere; my back was stiff, my ankles felt tight and my knees hurt. The physio Nitin Patel had to\ntreat me for an hour and a half on the morning of the match and I told him that I wanted to finish the\nseries off at Gwalior so that I could ask to be rested for the third and final game of the series.\nWhen  I  got  to  the  ground,  all  the  pains  and  aches  had  just  disappeared!  I  don’t  know  how  it\nhappened but it was one of those days when everything seemed to go my way. We batted first and I\nbarely pushed at a ball from Wayne Parnell in the second over and was amazed to see it racing to the\nboundary. After that the balls consistently hit the middle of my bat and the run rate didn’t drop for the\nentire innings.\nI had some good partnerships, first with Dinesh Karthik, then with Yusuf Pathan and finally with\nMS Dhoni, and they all batted well to take the pressure off me. It was only after I had passed 175 that\nI started to think about a double hundred. I had lost a bit of strength by then and, unable to play big\nshots, switched to finding the gaps and running hard. I was still running even when I was in the 190s,\nwhile Dhoni was pounding the bowling at the other end.\nThe moment finally arrived in the fiftieth over of our innings, when I steered the ball behind point\nfor  a  single,  becoming  the  first  in  the  history  of  cricket  to  score  an  ODI  double  century.  I  was\nparticularly glad I had been able to achieve the landmark in front of a home crowd. The team total had\nreached 400 and the sensation could not have been any better. In the changing room, Sehwag said to\nme, ‘Aakhir aapne 200 bana hi diya!’ (So you finally did score the ODI double ton!)\nThe  job,  however,  was  only  half  done  and  we  knew  South Africa  had  successfully  chased  434  in\n2006 – against Australia, no less – so it wasn’t a time to relax. History was not repeated in Gwalior,\nthough, and in the end we managed to win the match convincingly by a 153-run margin.\nBack in the hotel, I was feeling really tired but, because of all the excitement, was unable to sleep.\nLying  awake  in  bed,  I  decided  to  check  my  phone  and  found  that  it  was  flooded  with  messages\ncongratulating me and I spent two hours responding to them, a task that eventually took me two days\nto complete. I was up early the next morning, too, but it didn’t really matter, as I was heading home\nfor a much-needed break after one of my best ever seasons in international cricket.\nI have to admit that there was another reason I could not sleep in Gwalior. The hotel authorities had\nvery kindly given both Dhoni and me a suite each and these were located at a fair distance from the\nrooms  of  the  rest  of  the  team.  My  suite  was  enormous  and  even  had  a  private  swimming  pool.  The\nbathroom was gigantic and was separated from the main living room by a glass door. Outside there\nwere huge trees and at night, with the silk curtains fluttering in the breeze, I didn’t find it the most\ncomfortable  room  to  sleep  in.  It  was  pitch  dark  outside  and  the  size  of  the  room,  together  with  the\nunfamiliar sights and sounds around, made me seriously uneasy and I had to keep the bathroom lights\non all night!\nAustralia in India, October 2010\nWe started the 2010–11 season with a two-Test series against Australia. In the first match in Mohali at\nthe beginning of October, VVS Laxman played one of his best ever innings for the team. Needing 216\nto win, we had lost our eighth wicket with 92 runs still to get and Laxman, nursing a sore back, was\nour only hope. He batted like a man possessed, supported by Ishant Sharma, who showed exemplary\ngrit for his 31. Though Ishant fell with 11 runs still to get, Laxman batted on and took us over the line,\nto win by one wicket. Laxman tormented the Australians throughout his career and this was another\noccasion when they threw everything at him but still couldn’t dislodge him. Laxman is one of the few\nbatsmen capable of playing two different shots off every ball and his supple wrists made him a joy to\nwatch from the other end.\nHaving beaten Australia at Mohali, we had already retained the Border-Gavaskar Trophy when we\narrived  at  Bangalore  for  the  second  and  final  Test  of  the  series  on  9  October. At  the  Chinnaswamy\nStadium, Australia batted first, scoring a healthy 478, helped by a career-best 128 from Marcus North.\nI felt in good form from the very start of my innings. Not out on 44 at the end of day two, I batted\nthrough  the  whole  of  the  next  day  and  remained  unbeaten  on  191.  I  reached  my  forty-ninth  Test\nhundred with consecutive sixes off Nathan Hauritz. It was my sixth Test century of the year and I had\namassed more than 1000 Test runs in a calendar year for the sixth time in my career.\nI  eventually  fell  for  214  and,  with  the  help  of  Murali  Vijay’s  139,  we  managed  a  slender  first-\ninnings lead of seven runs before our bowlers got in on the act and dismissed Australia for just 223 in\ntheir second innings. We needed 207 to win the series 2–0 and I had the privilege of taking the team to\nvictory with young Cheteshwar Pujara, who, on debut, scored a valiant 72 not out batting at number\nthree, a position he has now made his own for India. I am convinced he has a great future ahead of him\nas a Test player.\nAn unwelcome distraction\nNext  up  was  a  three-Test  home  series  against  New  Zealand  in  November  2010.  Though  we  won  the\nseries 1–0, my own form took a dip. Everyone had started talking about my fiftieth Test hundred and it\nbecame hard to concentrate. The crowds were trying to get behind me and in Hyderabad, during the\nsecond Test, people kept waving at me even when I was batting. My usual routine was to walk away\ntowards the square-leg umpire after playing each ball, but the crowd at square leg went up every time I\nlooked at them, which unsettled me. I know they meant well, but I couldn’t help thinking to myself,\n‘They should let me bat in peace,’ and it wasn’t long before I was out.\nWhen  you  are  batting  well,  it’s  good  to  have  the  crowd  behind  you  like  that.  When  you  are\nstruggling, it can make things doubly difficult. After the Hyderabad Test I said to Gary and Paddy that\nI  was  looking  forward  to  the  South Africa  series  because  at  least  the  crowds  there  wouldn’t  obsess\nabout it so much.\nI actually had a good chance to get the century out of the way in Nagpur in the third Test, which\nstarted on 20 November. I was 57 not out overnight in our only innings and went in on the third day\nfeeling pretty confident. It didn’t work out, however, as I lost my wicket after adding only four runs to\nmy score, getting an edge off the left-arm seamer Andy McKay to the wicketkeeper. It was a ball that\nkicked up from short of a good length – the only one to do so all morning.\nIndia in South Africa, December 2010–January 2011\nPlaying South Africa in South Africa was always a difficult proposition. The nature of the pitches, an\nexcellent fast-bowling attack and a good batting unit combined to make them a formidable opponent\nat home.\nIn a poor start to the series, we were bowled out for 136 in our first innings at Centurion Park on 16\nDecember, with Morne Morkel taking five wickets, and it was almost impossible to stage a comeback\nfrom  that  position.  I  was  the  top  scorer  with  36  and  I  wasn’t  playing  too  badly  when  a  Dale  Steyn\ndelivery  came  in  more  than  expected  to  trap  me  in  front.  South Africa  put  together  a  huge  total  in\nresponse, with a double century for Jacques Kallis and hundreds for Amla and de Villiers, and we were\nleft to bat for almost two and a half days to save the game.\nWe at least put up more of a fight in the second innings. Dhoni and I were involved in a very good\ncounter-attacking partnership of 172 and I was relieved to make my fiftieth Test hundred at last. We\ncould see the South Africans getting frustrated and towards the end of the fourth day Dale Steyn and I\nexchanged a few words. The fading light had prompted Graeme Smith to give Steyn a final burst and\nhe came charging in. At one point he joked to me that he wasn’t bowling too fast, for it was a touch\nabove 150 kph. At this I asked him, ‘Where was your bravado when the sun was out?’ To be honest, all\nthis  banter  did  was  strengthen  my  resolve.  It  was  all  in  good  spirit,  though.  I  have  always  been\nopposed to ugly sledging, but a little bit of banter isn’t a bad thing on the cricket field and in fact can\nadd something to a high-intensity contest – as long as it remains within reasonable limits, of course.\nWe had lost eight wickets by the end of day four and on the final day South Africa closed out the\nmatch comfortably to win by ten wickets. We went to Durban for the Boxing Day Test knowing that\nwe had a hard task ahead of us. Yet the improved batting effort in the second innings at Centurion had\ngiven us a bit of a boost, and we felt we had at least adapted to the conditions by the time we stepped\nout in Durban.\nThe start of the Boxing Day Test match was different, to say the least. There was a light drizzle on\nthe  first  morning  and  yet  the  pitch  was  left  uncovered.  Even  the  pitch  report  was  done  by  the\ncommentators braving the drizzle, a fact that was brought to my attention by one of my team-mates.\nThe more the moisture, the more it was expected to favour the South African fast bowlers. I remember\ntelling my team-mate that such things don’t matter and it all evens out in the end.\nThis reminded me of something that had happened in Melbourne in December 2003. On the last day\nof the Test match, with Australia needing 97 runs to win, there was a delay to the start of play despite\nconditions  apparently  being  perfect.  The  reason  was  that  the  pitch  had  been  tampered  with  by  the\ngroundsmen, in clear violation of the rules. At the end of day four, there was a big crack in the pitch as\na result of the wear and tear, and balls landing in the crack could have done anything. To our surprise,\nthe  groundsmen  had  filled  up  the  crack  before  the  start  of  play  on  day  five,  incurring  the  umpires’\nwrath.  The  umpires  spotted  it  because  the  repaired  area  had  not  fully  dried  out  and  was  a  different\ncolour from the rest of the wicket. The umpires had to instruct the groundsmen to undo the repair and\nrestore the pitch to its original condition.\nDurban was a low-scoring Test match but no less exciting for that. Zaheer came back to lead our\nattack and both he and Bhajji bowled brilliantly after we had made a modest 205 in our first innings.\nThey  combined  well  to  finish  South Africa  off  for  just  131  in  their  first  innings  and  were  aided  by\nsome  brilliant  catching  behind  the  wickets.  Rahul  picked  up  his  200th  catch  in  this  match  when  he\ncaught Dale Steyn off Bhajji at slip. It was one of Rahul’s best catches and he had to dive full length\nto  his  left  and  pick  it  up  almost  from  behind  the  wicketkeeper.  We  celebrated  the  dismissal  in  the\nknowledge that the match was gradually turning in our favour.\nIn  our  second  innings,  it  was  another  VVS  Laxman  special  that  got  us  out  of  trouble.  He  showed\nclass in his innings of 96 and gave us a lead of over 300 to defend in the final innings. Laxman batted\nbrilliantly with the tail, which was something he was a master at in the latter stages of his career. He\nwas always unflustered and exuded a sense of calm which rubbed off on the other batsmen.\nIt was now up to Zaheer, Ishant, Sreesanth and Bhajji to finish the job and level the series. They did\nit  in  some  style.  South  Africa  were  never  allowed  to  get  away  and  our  bowlers  sent  down  some\nunplayable deliveries. Sreesanth’s ball to Kallis that jumped from short of a length and left him in no\nposition to do anything was the best of the match. Zaheer had taken six wickets in the match and had\nagain  shown  his  importance  as  the  leader  of  the  attack.  It  was  an  amazing  victory,  one  of  our  best\naway wins.\nBefore the final Test, I met up with Anjali and the kids and my friends Vivek and Sonia Palkar in\nCape Town on 30 December and we celebrated the Durban win and the penultimate day of 2010 at a\nfantastic vineyard, the Constantia Uitsig. The place also had a cricket field and an excellent restaurant.\nIt was an experience I was looking forward to, having consciously tried to learn more about red wine\nafter visiting Australia in 1999. The celebrations continued on 31 December, when the team ushered in\nthe New Year at a fabulous hotel in the foothills of Table Mountain.\nIn the third and deciding Test match at Cape Town on 2 January 2011, South Africa batted first on a\npitch that offered reasonable help for the seam bowlers throughout the match. The ball was doing a lot\noff the pitch and in the air and batting wasn’t easy. It was apparent to us all that South African captain\nGraeme  Smith  was  not  at  all  comfortable  against  Zaheer’s  left-arm  swing.  This  was  evident  to  us\nwhen he played a ball to midwicket and just jogged a single when he could easily have picked up two\nruns. I remember Bhajji running beside the ball and urging Smith to go for a second run. His refusal to\ndo  so  suggested  he  had  lost  the  mental  battle  to  Zaheer,  and  we  used  the  opportunity  to  give  him  a\nhard time in the middle. Kallis played brilliantly again, however, and, thanks to his 161, South Africa\nposted a competitive 362 in their first innings.\nI went in to bat towards the end of day two and played a handful of deliveries to settle in. Then I\ncame  forward  to  a  ball  from  Dale  Steyn  pitched  on  middle-and-leg  and  played  it  to  midwicket  for\nfour.  Everything  about  that  shot  –  the  swing  and  flow,  my  body  position  and  foot  movement  –  felt\nperfect and something told me I was in for a good innings.\nThe next day I resumed on 49, knowing the morning was going to be tough. Gautam Gambhir and I\nwere  up  against  two  of  the  finest  bowlers  in  the  world  in  Dale  Steyn  and  Morne  Morkel  –  and  in\nhelpful  bowling  conditions.  In  an  attempt  to  counter  the  movement,  I  deliberately  stood  outside  the\ncrease. My thinking was that if I was beaten from there, the ball would most likely go over the stumps.\nTo  get  bowled  I  would  have  to  miss  an  overpitched  delivery,  which  was  unlikely,  and  if  the  South\nAfricans decided to dig in short I could play the upper cut over the slips.\nFor the entire first hour, I played Dale Steyn while Gautam negotiated Morne Morkel and we both\nscored a number of fours in the first ten overs. It seemed that whenever we connected, the ball raced to\nthe boundary. The South Africans had a lot of fielders in catching positions and it meant we got full\nvalue for our shots. I went into lunch unbeaten on 94 and knew it would be one of my best hundreds if\nI managed to get there. The task wasn’t easy, with the second new ball just two overs old.\nMy tactic of batting outside the crease seemed to work. That day the only delivery for which I stood\ninside the crease was the fifth ball from Morne Morkel after lunch. I had a premonition that Morkel\nwould bowl short and so moved back inside the crease, ready to play the hook shot. Sure enough, the\nball  turned  out  to  be  a  chest-high  bouncer  and,  though  I  got  a  top  edge,  the  ball  flew  over  the\nwicketkeeper’s head for six, taking me to the fifty-first, and last, Test hundred of my career.\nI  know  it’s  bizarre  but  it  seemed  to  me  that  five  days  earlier  I  had  seen  Morne’s  delivery  in  a\ndream. In the dream he had bowled a bouncer to me that I hooked to get to my hundred. I mentioned\nthis to my batting partner Dhoni, saying ‘Yeh ball mere life mein pehle bhi aaya hai. Mein yeh pehle\ndekh chuka hoon. Aaj ye dusri bar ho raha hai.’ (This delivery has already come once before in my\nlife.  I  have  seen  and  faced  this  delivery  before.  Today  I  faced  it  for  a  second  time.)  Who  knows,\nmaybe it was the dream that prompted me to stand back inside the crease for that one ball!\nWhen Harbhajan Singh came in, we were still more than a hundred runs behind South Africa and\nneeded one more decent partnership to get close to their total, but Harbhajan was finding it difficult to\nnegotiate  Steyn’s  fast  swinging  deliveries.  Bhajji  had  scored  consecutive  hundreds  against  New\nZealand in the series before and was in good batting form, but those conditions were not best suited to\nhim.\nI went up to tell him to forget about technique for the time being: ‘Batsman ki tahra batting mat kar\ntu. Technique bhul ja. Agar ball tere range me dikhi tu ghuma. Ghuma tu kyun ki runs chahiye humhe.\nKaise  bhi  ho  runs  chahiye.’  (Don’t  try  to  bat  like  a  batsman.  Forget  about  technique  for  the  time\nbeing. If you see the ball in your arc just hit it. We need runs at the moment. It doesn’t matter how\nthey come as long as they come.)\nHarbhajan  listened  to  the  advice  and  in  no  time  was  on  his  way.  He  pulled  the  left-arm  seamer\nLonwabo Tsotsobe for six and hit Morne Morkel for a four. But his best shot was off Dale Steyn. It\nwas a full delivery and Harbhajan just stood there and hit through the line. Bhajji has power and the\nshot sailed over the long-on boundary at least ten rows back for a huge six. To add insult to injury,\nBhajji offered a wry smile to Steyn, who by now was furious.\nBhajji’s assault forced Graeme Smith to push his fielders back and so I walked up to Bhajji again to\nsay that he could stop trying to hit every ball now; he could just tap the ball and run. Our partnership\nyielded 76 very valuable runs and when Bhajji was finally out for 40 with the score on 323 we were\nwithin striking distance of the South African total. Eventually we managed a two-run lead.\nOur bowlers started well in the South African second innings and Bhajji was again simply brilliant.\nHe snapped out the first four South African wickets with just 64 on the board and when Zaheer picked\nup AB de Villiers with the score on 98, we started to believe a series win was possible. Ashwell Prince\ngot out with the score on 130 and we needed just one more wicket to get into the tail. Instead, Kallis\nand  Mark  Boucher  put  together  a  match-saving  partnership.  Kallis  played  a  superb  innings  despite\nnursing a rib injury and his second hundred of the match took the game and also the series beyond us.\nWe were left to bat out the last day for a draw, which we did fairly comfortably.\nLooking back, this was our best chance to win a series in South Africa. With half the side out for 98,\nall we needed was one final burst to roll over the opposition, but instead we let South Africa off the\nhook. Bhajji took seven wickets, but unfortunately the fast bowlers weren’t quite so successful at the\nother end. In normal circumstances, a 1–1 series result in South Africa would be considered a really\ngood performance, but this was clearly a contest we should have won.\nWeighty matters\nThe Test series was followed by a one-day series, which in effect would start our preparations for the\n2011 World Cup. Annoyingly, I injured my hamstring right at the start of the series and was forced to\nreturn to India. Before leaving, I asked every member of the squad to make a pledge. I told my team-\nmates that with the World Cup in the subcontinent approaching, which was one of the most significant\ncompetitions  of  our  lives,  it  was  important  for  everybody  to  sacrifice  something  ahead  of  the\ntournament. My suggestion was to lose 3 kilos each and become a fitter side in the process.\nI kept my promise and in fact lost 3.8 kilos. Some of my team-mates did so as well. To do this I had\nto watch my diet and was on salads after returning to Mumbai. I underwent a rigorous rehabilitation\nprogramme  on  my  hamstring  under  the  watchful  eyes  of  Patrick  Farhat,  physio  of  the  Mumbai\nIndians, and also hit the gym regularly to strengthen my upper body. The World Cup was promising to\nbe  the  biggest  tournament  of  my  life.  It  was  the  one  title  that  had  eluded  me  and  there  was  a  good\nchance it would be my last crack at becoming a world champion – and on home soil too.\nIndia in Bangladesh 2010\n1st Test.

            "title": "WORLD CUP 2011\n",
            "data": "The  2011  World  Cup  was  jointly  hosted  by  India,  Sri  Lanka  and  Bangladesh  and  we  launched  our\ncampaign against Bangladesh in the very first game of the competition on 19 February in Dhaka. As\nwe knew only too well, having lost to them in the 2007 World Cup in the Caribbean, Bangladesh can\nbe  a  dangerous  one-day  side  and  at  the  Shere  Bangla  National  Stadium  in  Mirpur  they  had  raucous\ncrowd support.\nThe general excitement was the first thing that struck us when we arrived in Bangladesh. Every time\nwe went for practice there were close to 30,000 people outside the ground waiting to catch a glimpse\nof the cricketers. Most of them didn’t have tickets for the game, but they were happy just to be there\nsinging, dancing and enjoying the moment. The passionate and enthusiastic Dhaka crowd undoubtedly\nadded a unique dimension to the tournament.\nWe  were  feeling  confident  after  winning  both  of  our  warm-up  games  against Australia  and  New\nZealand  in  Chennai  and  we  all  knew  this  was  our  best  chance  to  win  cricket’s  ultimate  prize.  The\nwhole country was behind the team during the competition – in fact, for a month and a half it seemed\nthat  all  that  mattered  in  India  was  how  we  fared  in  the  World  Cup.  However,  we  needed  to  remain\ncalm, and Gary, Paddy Upton, Mike Horn – the well-known explorer who was with us for most of the\nWorld Cup and shared stories of his adventures –  and the support staff did a wonderful job of keeping\nour minds on the task at hand.\nIn  Dhaka  I  invited  Yuvraj  Singh  to  my  room  to  have  dinner.  I  have  always  enjoyed  a  special\nfriendship with Yuvi and believed that he had a key role to play in the tournament. Yuvi was a little\ndown at the time, as things had not been going well for him, so I encouraged him to set some targets\nand concentrate on meeting them. We really needed a fully focused Yuvraj and I am delighted to say\nthat’s what we got from him all the way through the tournament.\nIt is a priceless moment in a cricketer’s career when he lines up for the national anthem at the start\nof  a  multi-nation  competition.  Right  through  my  career,  listening  to  the  anthem  while  standing\nalongside my team-mates has given me goosebumps. As they played the ‘Jana Gana Mana’ at Mirpur,\nnone of us could hold back our emotions. We knew that for the millions of Indians supporting us, what\nwe were playing was not just a game but a passion.\nWe won the toss and Virender Sehwag and I stepped out to start our campaign. Viru began in style,\nhitting the very first ball for a four, and we were off. The early nerves disappeared in no time and we\nstarted to enjoy ourselves. We set up a good foundation, scoring at a fair clip, before I was run out for\n28  and  then  Gautam  Gambhir  for  39.  Viru  was  sublime  in  his  innings  of  175  and  Virat  Kohli\ncontributed  a  superbly  orchestrated  century  to  help  take  us  to  370–4.  In  the  end  we  won  the  match\ncomfortably by 87 runs. The 2007 defeat had been avenged and we were off to the start we had hoped\nfor.\nAn epic encounter\nOur  next  match  was  against  England  in  Bangalore  on  27  February  and,  as  it  was  our  first  match  at\nhome, the excitement was off the scale.\nSomething a little odd happened just hours before the England match. In the tournament I was using\na favourite bat of mine, the one I had used the previous season, when I was the ICC Cricketer of the\nYear. Though it was showing its age, I had not discarded it. Rather, I had repaired it time and again\nand had even sent it to the bat manufacturers for restoration. There was a kind of emotional bond with\nthis bat and every time I couriered it to the manufacturers I felt nervous and prayed that it would not\nget lost in transit. In the dressing room, with just a few hours left until the match, for some reason I\nstarted to knock in a brand-new bat and work on it in my usual way to get the weight exactly right. I\neven remember telling myself that I was being foolish and wasting my time, because there was no way\nI would be using a new bat and I would be better off concentrating on the game.\nWe won the toss at the Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bangalore and opted to bat first. I used my trusted\nold  bat  and  managed  to  hit  a  few  boundaries.  However,  most  of  them  were  deflections  behind  the\nwicket and it was only when I tried to play a square cut off Ajmal Shahzad that I realized something\nwas wrong. It was a full-blooded stroke but the ball did not travel to the fielder as fast as it should\nhave. It was time to retire the old bat and call for the new one I had been knocking in. While I felt a\nlittle sad sending the old bat back to the pavilion, I did score a century with the new one – though I\nended up breaking it in the quarter-final against Australia.\nI have always enjoyed playing in Bangalore. I began cautiously and with Sehwag in full flow I was\ncontent to anchor the innings, but I decided to push the accelerator when Viru was dismissed for 35.\nGraeme Swann was England’s leading spinner and I hit him for consecutive sixes at the start of his\nsecond  spell,  turning  the  momentum  in  our  favour.  I  was  finally  out  for  120  and,  with  fifties  from\nGambhir and Yuvi, we made 338 in our fifty overs.\nEngland  were  brilliant  in  reply  and  also  benefited  from  the  very  heavy  dew,  which  meant  our\nspinners had been rendered ineffective. In conditions of heavy dew the ball just skids on to the bat,\nsomething England were to encounter in their match against Ireland at Bangalore. (The Irish, despite\nlosing five wickets cheaply, managed to get home, with Kevin O’Brien scoring a very good hundred.)\nAgainst us, Andrew Strauss played one of his best ever one-day innings, making 158, and he almost\ntook England to victory before Zaheer pulled it back for us with a superb second spell, taking three\nwickets for just 11. The match finally ended in a tie, and it was a terrific advertisement for the game.\nA  total  of  676  runs  were  scored  and  still  the  two  sides  could  not  be  separated.  The  fans  loved  the\ncontest and the World Cup had captured the imagination of the cricket-playing world.\nIt was immediately after this match that talk of us winning the title started in the digital world and\nslowly the messages started reaching us in the dressing room. These discussions were based not just\non our on-field performances. Someone had pointed out that every time Dhoni had been involved in a\ntie  in  a  multi-nation  competition,  he  had  ended  up  winning  the  title.  This  had  been  the  case  in  the\nWorld Twenty20 in 2007 (the India–Pakistan game was tied before India won in a bowl-out), in the\nIPL and even in the 2010 Champions League Twenty20 that Dhoni had won. This World Cup, it was\nargued, would be no different.\nThere’s many a slip\nWe  won  our  next  two  pool  matches  against  Ireland  and  the  Netherlands  fairly  comfortably  and  met\nSouth Africa in Nagpur on 12 March 2011. It was this match that in many ways turned our campaign\non its head. We began well and were soon firmly in control. Sehwag and I got off to a quick start – I\nscored  my  ninety-ninth  international  century  in  this  match,  but  it  was  not  much  talked  about  at  the\ntime because the focus was squarely on the World Cup – and we set South Africa a target of 297 after\na  dramatic  batting  collapse,  losing  nine  wickets  in  the  last  ten  overs,  with  Steyn  getting  a  five-for.\nEventually  we  lost  the  match  with  two  balls  of  the  South African  innings  remaining  and  the  defeat\nhurt us badly.\nUnsurprisingly, there was stinging criticism in the media. We had slipped once but we all knew we\ncould not afford to slip again. We simply had to get the campaign back on track in the next match,\nagainst the West Indies in Chennai on 20 March, and we managed to do just that, thanks to a Yuvraj\nSingh century and a surprise slower ball from Zaheer Khan to dismiss the in-form Devon Smith for\n81.  The  crucial  knockout  phase  was  about  to  begin  and  in  the  quarter-final  at Ahmedabad  we  drew\nAustralia, the defending champions.\nSpicing up practice\nIt was on the eve of that West Indies match that I tried to introduce an element of fun into my batting\npractice. I was practising to some throw-downs from Gary Kirsten and was just about to wrap up the\nsession when the idea came to me. I decided to close my eyes for six deliveries, just after the bowler\nreleased the ball, then I asked Gary if he had noticed anything different. Gary said he hadn’t, except\nthat my head was staying up when I was driving. I had to keep my head steady, because with your eyes\nshut you can easily lose the path of the ball with a very slight movement of the head. When I told him\nI’d  had  my  eyes  closed,  he  was  shocked.  I  explained  that  I  had  watched  his  wrist  position  when  he\nreleased the ball, to see if it was, say, an outswinger, and then closed my eyes and visualized the path\nthe ball would travel. After that I went a step further by keeping my eyes shut and telling the fielders\nwhere I had hit the ball, based on how and where I felt the ball on the bat. It was just for fun, and I\nonly  did  it  once,  but  it  did  help  me  focus  on  the  release  of  the  ball,  which  is  so  important  for  a\nbatsman.\nIn  my  early  days  I  used  to  practise  in  an  even  more  unusual  manner.  In  the  monsoon  season  in\nMumbai – in June/July/August – it’s not possible to play much normal cricket, but my friends and I\nwould still get together and play in the rain, using rubber balls. Sometimes this would be on a normal\npitch without any cover, sometimes on a wet concrete pitch and sometimes on a concrete pitch with a\nplastic cover. There were times when I actually wore a proper helmet and my full cricket gear in the\npouring  rain.  The  rubber  ball  would  come  off  the  surface  at  quite  a  pace  and  it  was  a  good  way  of\nsharpening up my reactions. While practising in the rain I would always ask the guys to bowl to me\nfrom 18 yards. They were allowed to bowl or chuck, but the object was always to try to hit me!\nIt was great fun but it also had a serious side. At the time, we didn’t have any indoor facilities and I\nhad to practise somehow. Things have changed, of course, but in some ways I miss all that. I’ve even\nthought  about  doing  it  again  with  my  son. Young  players  now  grow  up  with  all  the  best  facilities,\nwhereas I had nowhere to go. I had to practise on the roads or on wet outfields, where first the mud\nwould splash onto my face and then the ball would follow! It was tough at times but it all contributed\nto my enjoyment of cricket, and I would love my son to share that experience.\nTaking on the champions\nAustralia were chasing their fourth consecutive World Cup title and, remarkably, were meeting us for\nthe first time in the competition since beating us in the 2003 final in South Africa. I remember two\nthings about getting ready for the quarter-final. First, I did not eat non-vegetarian or spicy food after\nsetting foot in Ahmedabad, which was boiling hot. I don’t really know why not. Something inside just\nseemed to suggest that I should stay away from that kind of food in the heat. I ate a lot of salad and\nyoghurt and things that I hoped would keep my system cool.\nThe other thing I remember is that I did not sleep well. This time it was not the mounting tension\nbut my hotel bed that caused the problem. On the eve of the match I even resorted to sleeping on the\nfloor.  It  was  our  masseur Amit  Shah  who  pointed  out  that  the  problem  was  with  my  bed.  When  he\ncame to give me a head massage to help me sleep, he immediately noticed that it was raised on one\nside, but unfortunately it was impossible to replace the bed at that late hour!\nPlaying  against Australia  is  always  a  high-pressure  contest,  and  a  knockout  game  even  more  so.\nDespite a good start by Australia at Ahmedabad on 24 March, our bowlers did well in the powerplay to\nkeep the run rate close to four an over. Eventually, the Australians put 260 on the board, with Ponting\nmaking an impressive 104, and we knew it wouldn’t be easy to chase down that total under lights.\nViru and I were aware of the enormity of the occasion as we walked out to deafening applause at the\nSardar  Patel  Stadium.  It  really  was  now  or  never.  When  Viru  got  out  for  15  trying  to  pull  Shane\nWatson, caught at midwicket, we had put 44 on the board. Gautam and I added exactly 50 runs before\nI  got  out  after  reaching  my  half-century.  We  then  lost  Gautam  and  Dhoni  in  quick  succession  and\nSuresh Raina, playing only his second World Cup game, joined Yuvraj in the middle with 74 runs still\nneeded.\nAt the time, I was lying on the massage table with my eyes closed, with Viru on the other table. I\nlay  there  completely  still  while Amit  Shah  gave  me  a  neck  massage.  I  was  actually  praying,  asking\nGod to do the best for us. At one point Viru thought I was sleeping and told Amit Shah, ‘ Tu apna time\nwaste  mat  kar,  woh  so  gaya  hai.  Ja  ke  match  dekh  le. ’  (Don’t  waste  your  time.  He  has  gone  off  to\nsleep, please go and watch the match.) I could hear his every word, but I didn’t want to move or react.\nAmit  was  aware  that  I  was  awake  and  said,  ‘Woh  soya  nahi  hai,  mujhe  malum  hai! ’  (He  is  not\nsleeping, I know!)\nAs Yuvraj and Raina gradually pulled things round I remember hearing my team-mates shout, ‘One\nmore boundary … ah! Two more runs.’ We were getting very close to the semi-final and were about to\nknock  the  three-time  champions  out  of  the  World  Cup! And  when Yuvi  hit  the  final  boundary,  the\nIndian dressing room went mad. It was an unforgettable match.\nOn our way back to the hotel, it seemed as if the entire city was celebrating – or rather the entire\ncountry. When the team bus left the ground at close to midnight, there were still a few thousand fans\nat  the  gate  waiting  to  cheer  us.  People  were  honking,  dancing  and  waving  the  tricolour  at  every\nroundabout and street corner – and we hadn’t even reached the final yet.\nI  remember  standing  on  the  balcony  of  my  hotel  room  and  watching  the  celebrations  till  late  at\nnight. I also remember telling Anjali that it was an unbelievable sight and she had to see it to believe\nit. It emphasized to me yet again how much the World Cup meant to our cricket fans. However, it was\nonly to get bigger with India meeting Pakistan in the semi-final.\nNeighbours\nSoon after we landed in Mohali and were on our way back to the hotel, I asked my team-mates if any\nof  them  had  the  Amit  Kumar  song  ‘Bade  Achhe  Lagte  Hain’  on  their  iPods.  Finally,  it  was  Mane\nKaka,  our  masseur,  who  said  to  me  that  he  had  it  with  him.  Mane  Kaka  has  always  been  an\nexceptionally  affectionate  person,  constantly  doing  the  best  for  us  without  expecting  anything  in\nreturn. I subsequently requested DJ, our computer analyst, to download the song onto my iPod as soon\nas possible, and it was the only song I listened to for the next seven days.\nThe match in Mohali on 30 March was always likely to be the most intense of the competition and\nin fact it turned out to be one of the most pressured games of my career. Playing Pakistan in a World\nCup semi-final on Indian soil – it just couldn’t get any bigger. As the two teams practised side by side\nwe  could  feel  the  tension.  Both  teams  badly  wanted  to  win  this  one.  Up  till  then  India  had  an\nimpeccable record against Pakistan in World Cups, and we wanted to keep that record intact.\nWe got off to a dramatic start in what turned out to be a rollercoaster of a game, thanks to Virender\nSehwag taking on Umar Gul. He was the form fast bowler for Pakistan in the tournament and Viru’s\nassault  set  us  rolling.  Viru  raced  off  the  blocks  and  hit  Gul  for  four  fours  in  his  second  over.\nFortunately the Pakistanis dropped me a few times, the chance to midwicket being a relatively simple\none, and my innings of 85 proved vital as we lost a few quick wickets in the middle overs, with Wahab\nRiaz taking five in the match. Riaz bowled Yuvi first ball and the momentum shifted like a pendulum\nmany times in the course of the match. So much so that I had my heart in my mouth on a number of\noccasions  during  this  nailbiter.  Suresh  Raina  played  well  for  his  36  not  out  and  helped  us  to  260,\nexactly the score we had chased down in the quarter-final against Australia. It was a good total but not\na clear winning score on a decent pitch.\nIn their reply, Pakistan also got off to a good start, but just as the pressure was starting to build on\nus, Zaheer struck. Munaf also got a wicket in the powerplay and then Yuvraj took two quick wickets to\nput us in control. In the middle of the innings, Umar Akmal was trying to counter-attack but we knew\nthat all it would take was one good delivery. Harbhajan did the job for us by bowling Akmal with the\nfirst ball of his second spell. He had decided to come round the wicket and Akmal misjudged the line.\nPakistan still had a chance while Afridi and Misbah were batting, but then Afridi fell to Harbhajan,\ntrying to hit a full toss out of the ground. He would normally have made that shot nine times out of ten\nbut  on  that  night  he  spooned  a  simple  catch  to  cover.  It  was  one  of  those  days  when  things  seemed\ndestined to go our way. After dismissing Afridi, we knew we could close out the match. Soon enough\nMisbah holed out to Virat at long on and we were in the World Cup final. As if that wasn’t enough, I\nalso received the Player of the Match award, the third time I had that honour in a World Cup match\nagainst Pakistan.\nThe  celebrations  were  quite  something.  We  could  see  thousands  of  fans  waving  the  tricolour  and\ncelebrating in Mohali. Navigating our way back to the hotel was a tricky business, with every corner\ntaken  over  by  delirious  fans  wanting  to  relish  the  moment.  My  friend Aamir  Khan,  the  actor,  came\nover to my room to offer his congratulations and I remember chatting away into the small hours. It\nwas a night that India could never forget and we, having played a part in it, will never want to forget.\nA number of dignitaries had come to Mohali, including our prime minister, Dr Manmohan Singh.\nThe Pakistani premier, Yousaf Raza Gillani, was also present, but frankly we were not really taking in\nwhat  was  going  on  beyond  the  boundary  because  we  were  so  preoccupied  with  the  job  at  hand.  We\nwere soon on our way to Mumbai, convinced that we were peaking at the right time.\nA city full of expectations\nWhen we arrived in Mumbai for the final against Sri Lanka, the first thing I noticed was the increased\npolice  presence.  It  didn’t  feel  like  the  same  city.  Despite  all  the  extra  security,  there  were  fans\neverywhere waiting to catch a glimpse of the team and wish us well. It was a kind of passion we had\nnot seen before.\nOn the way from the airport, the police didn’t want to take any chances and escorted our bus to the\nhotel.  On  the  way,  I  met Anjali  on  Mumbai’s  Sea  Link,  the  bridge  that  is  now  a  landmark  and  has\nmade commuting in the city much easier. (Before, there were times when I was playing a first-class\nmatch in Mumbai and I would choose to stay the night at the CCI rather than go to my own home, as it\ncould take an hour and thirty minutes to drive there, which is not what you want after a long day in the\nfield!) I had already informed the security personnel on the team bus that Anjali would be waiting for\nme  and  that  I  would  be  moving  from  the  team  bus  to  my  car.  Driving  my  own  car  didn’t  make  the\njourney to the hotel any quicker, because I was keeping the team bus in my sight. There were people\neverywhere and I don’t think I went above 40 kph. In fact I remember saying to Anjali that my car\nmust think someone else is driving it at that speed.\nWhile driving to the hotel I was also trying to take stock of the situation. It was hard to imagine I\nwas going to play the World Cup final in front of my home crowd. I couldn’t help thinking back to\nMarch  2007  when  I  had  returned  to  Mumbai  after  a  disastrous  World  Cup  campaign.  That  year,  in\nhindsight,  was  a  real  nightmare.  However,  2011  felt  different,  because  we  were  gradually  writing  a\nnational fairy tale. I told Anjali that this time there was no turning back.\nWe had played Sri Lanka a number of times in the recent past, in 2010 and 2011, and knew exactly\nwhat to expect from them in the final. They were a good side but we were confident of beating them.\nThere was no need for a long team talk. We did meet for a team dinner, but after barely five minutes\nof cricket discussion, Mike Horn took over. All through the final week, Mike talked to us about his\nexperiences. While for most of us there is always another day, for Mike it was often a matter of life\nand death. One mistake and it could all be over. The stories of how he coped with extreme pressure\nduring his adventures – such as circumnavigating the globe at the Equator without motorized transport\nor walking to the North Pole during the dark season – definitely helped us deal with our own concerns\non the eve of the World Cup final. They put our situation into perspective, reminding us that we were\nnot the worst off in the world.\nUnlike in Ahmedabad or even Mohali, I slept well in Mumbai on the eve of the final. On 2 April, we\nleft the hotel early for the stadium and I was surprised not to see a single soul on the way. Security\nwas so tight that fans were not even permitted to stand along the team bus’s route. It was difficult to\nbelieve  that  I  had  not  seen  a  single  cricket  fan.  However,  the  Wankhede  presented  a  completely\ndifferent picture. It was already packed, hours before the match was due to start.\nAs we did our warm-up exercises on the pitch, I could feel the buzz inside the stadium, which was\nfeeling  more  like  an  amphitheatre. All  round  there  were  excited  faces.  India  were  playing  the  most\nimportant match ever on home soil. No team had won the World Cup as hosts, but one good day and\nwe could call ourselves world champions for the rest of our lives.\nThe final\nWe managed to get off to a good start in the match thanks to an excellent early spell from Zaheer and\nsome great fielding at point and cover from Yuvraj and Raina. Zaheer reeled off three maidens on the\ntrot, which said it all. Sri Lanka lost Upul Tharanga for two to an excellent catch in the slips by Viru\noff Zaheer and we had sprinted off the blocks. While Zaheer was bowling very well, Sreesanth was not\nquite so effective from the other end. Harbhajan and I, fielding at mid off and mid on, kept telling him\nnot to give up, saying that he just needed to land one ball on the spot and he would get us a wicket. He\nsaid he was not feeling well and felt like being sick. To his credit, he forced himself to keep going in\nthe oppressive Mumbai heat. Sometimes you have to endure pain to succeed, especially when you are\nplaying the World Cup final.\nSri Lanka fought back well through Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene, two of the finest\nbatsmen  in  the  world.  But  as  was  the  case  throughout  the  World  Cup,  Yuvraj  made  a  vital\nbreakthrough to get us back in the match by having Sangakkara caught behind for 48. Jayawardene,\nhowever, was still out there and he played one of the truly great World Cup final innings. His century\nset the match up for Sri Lanka, with 274 the target that faced us.\nIt  was  not  insurmountable,  but  it  was  important  for  us  to  forge  partnerships  in  the  early  overs,\nbecause the wicket was expected to become slightly easier as the match progressed. The outfield was\ndewy and I thought it was important for us to try to get the ball outside the thirty-yard circle to make\nit wet. That would mean the ball would stop swinging. Unfortunately for us, we lost Sehwag for a duck\nin the first over of the chase and it was down to Gambhir and me to build a platform. I hit a couple of\ncrisp boundaries and was timing the ball well, but just when I thought the ball had stopped swinging, I\nwas tempted to play a drive outside the off stump. That ball from Malinga swung and I edged it to the\nwicketkeeper and was out for 18. It was disappointing, and I won’t forget the walk back to the dressing\nroom.\nWe  were  in  a  potentially  dangerous  situation  when  Virat  Kohli  arrived  at  the  crease  to  join\nGambhir. Virat had started the World Cup with a hundred against Bangladesh and now he finished off\nwith a key innings in the final. The importance of his contribution is not always acknowledged, but his\n35 was part of a key partnership, as both Gautam and Virat managed to score at a brisk pace and so the\nasking  rate  was  never  out  of  reach.  Once  Virat  was  out,  Dhoni  promoted  himself  up  the  order  to\nnegotiate the Sri Lankan off-spinners, Muralitharan, Randiv and Dilshan. It was the Gambhir–Dhoni\npartnership of 109 that won us the World Cup. Both played exceptionally well under intense pressure.\nI  have  to  confess  that  I  did  not  actually  see  what  millions  of  Indians  watched  with  ecstasy  and\ndelight that night. I did not see my ultimate dream being fulfilled, the moment I had waited to savour\nsince making my international debut in November 1989. The reason was that when Mahendra Singh\nDhoni hit the winning six at the Wankhede Stadium, I was with Virender Sehwag in the dressing room\npraying. I wasn’t asking God to help us win. All I wanted was that God should do what was best for us,\nfor  Indian  cricket  and  for  the  Indian  cricket  team.  I  had  turned  superstitious  on  the  night  and  made\nViru sit near me in one position. Neither of us ventured out till Dhoni’s shot had crossed the boundary.\nA little earlier, when it seemed that an Indian win was on the cards, Viru had wanted to go out of the\ndressing room to celebrate. I advised him not to till the match was finally over. I said to him that he\ncould  watch  the  moment  a  hundred  times  on  television  if  he  wanted  to,  but  for  the  time  being  he\nshould just sit where he was and pray. It was only after Dhoni’s shot had finally crossed the boundary\nthat I went out.\nMany people have asked me what I felt at that particular moment. Frankly, at first it was difficult to\ntake  in  that  we  had  won  the  World  Cup.  It  was  almost  as  if  there  was  still  a  match  left  in  the\ntournament.  But  when  I  ran  onto  the  ground  and  embraced  an  emotional Yuvi,  it  was  impossible  to\ncontrol my emotions. It was one of those life-changing moments and we wanted to live each and every\nsecond  of  it.  While  some  players  shouted  and  some  cried,  others  were  keen  to  go  ahead  with  the\nvictory lap in front of an ecstatic Wankhede crowd.\nVirat and Yusuf Pathan lifted me onto their shoulders and someone gave me an Indian flag to wave.\nBeing carried by my team-mates, waving the tricolour at my home ground, having won the World Cup\n– what more could I ask for? Life, to be honest, seemed complete. It was the greatest moment of my\ncricketing journey. Amidst all the euphoria, I remember telling Yusuf Pathan not to drop me. At this\nhe said, ‘Gir jayenge par aapko niche nahi aane denge.’ (We may fall down but we will not let you\ncome down.)\nIt felt astonishing. It was a kind of satisfaction I had never experienced before. Cricket’s greatest\nprize  was  finally  ours.  On  our  victory  lap,  I  waved  to  the  section  of  the  crowd  where  I  thought  my\nchildren  Sara  and Arjun  were  sitting.  I  waved  to  them,  hoping  they  would  see  me  do  so  and  come\ndown.  Luckily,  they  saw  me  wave  and  soon  joined  me  in  the  middle.  To  be  with  my  family  while\ncelebrating the greatest sporting moment of my life was special.\nAnjali was not at the ground. She had stuck to her superstition of not coming to the stadium and she\nleft home for the Wankhede only after we had won. She had a funny experience while driving to the\nground. It was one of those nights when anything goes. Men and women were jumping on top of cars\nto celebrate and no one was objecting. The country had never seen anything like it. Just as Anjali was\ntaking the turn to the Wankhede, a section of the crowd tried to get on top of her car to dance. At this\npoint  a  couple  of  boys  spotted  her  inside  and  said,  ‘Arre  yeh  unka  gaadi  hai,  unko  jaane  do.  Unke\njaane ke bad humlog nachenge.’ (Hey, it’s their [the Tendulkars’] car; let her go. We will dance after\nthe car has dropped her off.) And they did exactly that. After Anjali was dropped at the main gate, they\nclimbed on top of the car to dance, creating many dents, which we were happy to see as they brought\nback fond memories!\nSomething else that made the World Cup triumph really special was the fact that many of my team-\nmates  dedicated  the  achievement  to  me.  I  felt  overwhelmed.  Once  we  had  finished  with  the  awards\nceremony and the lap of honour, the scene of action moved to our dressing room. I opened the first\nbottle of champagne and subsequently made a point of getting it signed by all my team-mates. It now\nhas pride of place in the cellar at my house.\nWe tried to make the most of the moment in as many different ways as possible. We took countless\nphotographs. First it was the players, then we took some with Gary, who had just served out his last\nmatch as India coach. Paddy Upton and Mike Horn, both important members of our support unit, soon\njoined in and it seemed toally acceptable for adults to behave like children.\nAs  my  team-mates  were  posing  with  the  trophy  one  by  one,  I  remember  wandering  out  of  the\ndressing room to soak up the atmosphere. It seemed that not a single soul had left the ground. People\nwere  busy  capturing  every  possible  angle  on  their  mobile  phones.  I  saw  Sudhir  Gautam,  now  a\nfamiliar face in India as the man who paints his body with the tricolour and paints my surname and\nnumber  ‘10’  on  it,  blowing  his  conch  at  full  blast.  The  noise  from  his  conch  and  the  sound  of  the\nfirecrackers blended together to create quite an atmosphere. It felt surreal.\nI waved at Sudhir Gautam to come and join us inside the dressing room. He was startled to see me\ndo so, to say the least. For him it was totally unexpected. It was already a night to remember for us;\nhis was about to become even more memorable. I asked the security personnel to allow him into the\ndressing  room  and  passed  him  the  trophy  to  hold.  He  was  overwhelmed.  I  felt  a  deep  sense  of\nsatisfaction  at  being  able  to  make  him  so  happy.  He  had  travelled  with  us  all  the  way  through  the\nWorld Cup and it was our way of showing him and the rest of our fans that we cared. I only wish I\ncould have let every supporter at the Wankhede pose with the trophy.\nThe players’ families soon joined in the celebrations and I remember trying to explain to Arjun and\nSara the significance of the World Cup for a cricketer. I told them it was the pinnacle and could never\nbe  surpassed. Almost  two  hours  after  the  victory,  we  finally  left  for  the  hotel.  The  normally  short\njourney from the stadium to the hotel was one of the slowest but also one of the best of my life. While\nI  had  not  seen  a  soul  on  my  way  to  the  ground  in  the  morning,  on  the  way  back  there  was  a  sea  of\nhumanity and the journey took almost an hour.\nMarine Drive was quite a sight. Although I remember dancing and celebrating as a kid after India’s\nfirst World Cup win in 1983, the memory is a bit of a blur. This was our moment. It was liberation. I\nhad finally scaled cricket’s Everest and each and every soul on the streets of Mumbai was celebrating.\nWe had brought joy to their faces and that’s all we could have asked for as Indian cricketers.\nA night to remember\nThe  entrance  to  the  Taj  Mahal  Palace  hotel  had  been  cordoned  off  and  the  lobby  was  packed  with\npeople. When we entered we were presented with a bottle of champagne and a special cake, which I\ncut before heading up to our rooms on the sixth floor. The second round of celebrations was about to\nbegin.\nIn  the  confines  of  my  room,  Anjali  and  I  poured  each  other  a  drink  and  let  our  hair  down.  We\nplucked  flowers  out  of  the  bouquets  that  were  piled  everywhere  and  put  them  behind  our  ears  and\nstarted dancing to the music. This was the night of a World Cup triumph, so why should we restrain\nourselves? In an instant all that time away from my family, missing out on seeing my children grow\nup,  seemed  worthwhile.  Their  father  had  finally  become  part  of  a  World  Cup-winning  team,\nsomething he had strived for all his life.\nThe party went on into the early hours of the morning. With loud music blaring out, the doors to all\nthe  players’  rooms  were  wide  open. Anyone  could  come  in  and  have  a  drink  and  celebrate.  In  one\nmemorable moment Virat, Bhajji and Yuvi went down on their knees and sang ‘ Tujme rabh dikhta hai\nyaara mai kya karu’ (What to do, my friend, in you we see God himself!) from the film Rab Ne Bana\nDi Jodi and managed to seriously embarrass me.\nAt around 3 a.m., we were called to go up and join in a special celebration put together by the team\nmanagement. A couple of hours later, I finally went back to my room to get some sleep. This time I\nbolted my door, knowing that otherwise some of my team-mates were bound to crash in, as the party\nwas still in full swing.\nAt 7 a.m. I heard Zaheer Khan and Ashish Nehra banging on my door, wanting to share a drink. I\njust smiled to myself and went back to sleep.\nA happy homecoming\nThe day after the final went by in a rush. After fulfilling the ICC’s requirements of a few photo shoots\nand meeting our president, Mrs Pratibha Patil, at Raj Bhavan, I finally made it home in the evening. It\nwas  a  deeply  emotional  experience,  made  more  memorable  by  my  friends  and  neighbours,  who\nwelcomed me to our building by playing the dhol (drums) and letting off firecrackers. Every time I\ndid  something  worthwhile  in  my  career  my  friends  and  neighbours  wanted  to  celebrate  the\nhomecoming, and normally I would ask Anjali to persuade them not to because I felt embarrassed by\nsuch celebrations – but the World Cup was an exception!\nWhen my mother was performing aarti (a flame ritual for good luck) and putting the tika (vermilion\nblessing) on my forehead (a family ritual in most Maharashtrian families), it seemed that this time I\nhad come back to her having achieved something substantial. I felt as if I had performed my duties as\na son and deserved her welcome. My family was delighted with the achievement and I felt a sense of\ngenuine pride at having given them such joy.\nThere were countless bouquets of flowers waiting for me. Abhishek and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan,\ntwo of India’s best-known Bollywood stars, dropped by to congratulate me and we happily relived the\nfinal all over again.\nLooking back on it now, it still feels like a dream. Beating Australia, Pakistan and Sri Lanka in the\ncourse  of  one  week  to  win  the  World  Cup  in  front  of  huge  Indian  crowds  just  feels  unreal.  The\ntelevision  audience  for  our  semi-final  match  against  Pakistan,  I  was  told,  was  the  highest  ever\nrecorded in India’s sporting history. I must confess that I continue to get goose bumps every time I\nthink about that week.\nOn a personal note, I was pleased to have scored a total of 482 runs, the highest for India and the\nsecond highest in the tournament, at an average of 54 with two hundreds. I felt that I had proved to\nmyself that after twenty-two years of examination at the very highest level, I was still good enough to\ncarry on competing with the very best, that the hunger and the passion were still very much alive.\nA number of my friends have asked me why I didn’t retire from one-day cricket after winning the\nWorld Cup, as the summit had been scaled and there was nothing left for me to achieve. They may\nwell have a point. It could indeed have been a grand exit. Emotions were running high and the timing\ncould  not  have  been  better.  But  to  be  honest,  such  a  thought  never  occurred  to  me.  I  wanted  to\nremember the World Cup as a happy moment, and announcing my retirement straight after winning\nthe trophy would have shifted the focus from the cup triumph to my retirement.\nThe  Indian  cricket  team  had  stuck  together  through  difficult  times  to  make  the  world  stage  their\nown. Each player had made sacrifices and each one deserved to enjoy the moment. Cricket is a team\nsport and I feel immensely proud to have been part of the World Cup-winning team.\nFinally, I had always wanted one memorable send-off from international cricket that I could never\nforget in my life. Multiple send-offs can end up diluting the significance of the event and that was not\nsomething I had ever wanted.\nIndia in the 2011 World Cup\n1st match, Group B.

            "title": "THE QUEST FOR THE 100TH HUNDRED\n",
            "data": "India’s first international engagement after the World Cup was a tour of the West Indies in June 2011.\nI was allowed to opt out because India had a busy year ahead and I was desperate to spend some time\nwith my family. I had been playing continuous cricket for eight months and realized that if I travelled\nto the West Indies it would mean I had not spent much time with Anjali and the children for close to\ntwenty months. India had a number of assignments coming up and this was the one tour that coincided\nwith the kids’ summer holidays. I was on ninety-nine international centuries at the time but it never\noccurred  to  me  that  I  should  try  and  get  the  100th  ton  as  quickly  as  possible.  Then  again,  I  never\nimagined that I would have to wait for more than a year.\nIndia in England, July–August 2011\nI rejoined the team in July 2011 and was looking forward to playing against a resurgent English side in\ntheir home conditions. Under Andrew Strauss they had recently won the Ashes in Australia and were\nplaying some excellent cricket. However, we were still the number-one Test team and it was expected\nto  be  a  keenly  contested  series.  The  fact  that  our  recently  appointed  coach,  Duncan  Fletcher,  was\nreturning  to  take  on  the  England  team  he  used  to  coach  with  such  success  also  added  spice  to  the\nseries.\nFor me personally the tour did not start well. My foot started to trouble me on the first day of the\ntour when we played Somerset in a two-day fixture at Taunton. We fielded and by lunch the pain in\nmy toe was bad enough to make me stay off the field for treatment. When we got to London before the\nfirst Test match at Lord’s, I had a few scans done and it was revealed that the problem was again with\nthe sesamoid bone. While there was some inflammation, luckily it wasn’t serious enough to keep me\noff cricket and I played in all four Tests.\nAt Lord’s on 21 July 2011 we started reasonably well after winning the toss, with Zaheer picking up\nAndrew Strauss early on, but we were thrown off-course when Zaheer pulled a hamstring soon after\nlunch.  In  such  situations  you  can’t  do  much  but  rue  your  luck.  The  loss  of  the  leader  of  our  attack\nundoubtedly affected us for the rest of the series.\nI remember that on the very first day I saw Zaheer, way back at the start of his career, I told him he\nwould always have to take care of his body and bowl right through the year to keep himself fit. His\nphysique  was  such  that  he  needed  to  do  more  than  others  to  remain  in  good  shape.  Back  in  2005  I\nencouraged him to play county cricket, and when he came back to India after playing his first season\nin England, there was no doubt he was a more mature performer. Over the years he turned himself into\na match-winning premier fast bowler.\nTo add to our concerns, we lost Yuvraj in the second Test when he fractured his finger, then Bhajji\nsuffered  a  stomach-muscle  tear  and  Gautam  Gambhir  fell  over  and  had  severe  concussion,  which\nprevented him from opening the batting in the fourth Test. What’s more, we didn’t have Sehwag for\nthe first two Tests, as he was still recovering from a shoulder operation. I don’t want to take anything\naway  from  England,  who  played  superb  cricket  throughout  the  series,  but  it  was  a  remarkable\nsequence of disasters and it wasn’t easy to cope with the loss of so many key players.\nOne unexpected complication at Lord’s was that I found I had great difficulty picking up the ball\nfrom the new Media Centre End. England had tall fast bowlers in Chris Tremlett and Stuart Broad and\nI  had  serious  trouble  because  the  bowler’s  hand  was  sometimes  lost  against  the  dark-coloured  steps\nabove the sightscreen. This meant I had much less time to react than usual and I had to play the ball\noff the pitch rather than watching the bowler’s wrist. From the Pavilion End I had no problem at all.\nAfter the game I spoke about the problem with the late Christopher Martin-Jenkins, who was then\nPresident of the MCC, and he promised to do something about it for the ODI at Lord’s later in the tour\n–  but  in  the  end  I  wasn’t  able  to  play  in  that  game.  More  recently,  when  I  captained  an  MCC  XI\nagainst Shane Warne’s Rest of the World XI at Lord’s in the Bicentenary Match in July 2014, I raised\nthe problem again. They couldn’t increase the height of the sightscreen, but I asked them to make the\nstaircase above it as white as possible, which they did. In the end, I didn’t have any problems because\nPeter  Siddle  was  bowling  and  he’s  not  as  tall  as,  say,  Broad  or  Tremlett  and  that  makes  a  huge\ndifference.\nI must also confess that while I love Lord’s, I always found it difficult to cope with the slope that\nruns  across  the  ground,  no  matter  how  much  I  tried  to  work  out  its  effect.  I  remember  facing  Chris\nLewis once when he was bowling from the Pavilion End. He tended to bowl inswingers and I thought\nI’d worked out that the slope would bring the ball in to me even more, so I played inside the line – and\nthe ball went the other way and I was bowled!\nIn 2011, on the evening of the third day of the Lord’s Test, I was laid low by a viral infection. My\nfriend  Atul  Bedade,  the  former  India  international  and  someone  who  has  always  supported  me  at\ncritical times, had come to visit me for the evening, but I realized something was wrong as soon as we\ngot back to the hotel. I asked for a paracetamol from the physio and took it while ordering an early\ndinner in the room. By 8 p.m. we had finished our meal and I suggested to Atul that he should take off,\nbut Atul didn’t want to leave me in that state and kindly decided to sleep on the sofa, so that he could\nmake sure I was all right.\nBy the middle of the night my condition had worsened and the next morning I was in no state to get\nup. Atul called Ashish Kaushik, our phsyio, and he advised complete rest. This was the only time in\nmy career I was not able to join the team on the morning of a match. I slept in my hotel room till well\nafter lunch and it was only when I checked the score on television that I called our team manager and\ntold him I was coming to the ground. I wanted to try and play a part in the second innings, as I thought\nI was needed.\nAlthough I wasn’t able to contribute much to the team, I forced myself to field towards the end of\nthe England innings, to make sure I would have an opportunity to bat on day five. At the end of the\nday’s play, I was in a really bad state. To make things worse, when I got back to the hotel I found that\nthe air conditioning in my room had leaked and everything was wet. While I did manage to bat for a\nwhile on day five, I was nowhere near my best and found it difficult to maintain my balance in the\nmiddle.\nEngland ended up winning the first Test comfortably, thanks to centuries from Pietersen and Prior\nand five wickets for James Anderson in the second innings. In the second Test at Trent Bridge, starting\non 29 July, we came back strongly and Sreesanth and Ishant Sharma helped reduced England to 124–8\nat one point in their first innings, but Swann and Broad managed to bail them out, taking their score to\n221. It was still not a threatening total, however, and we passed it with six wickets in hand, only to\nlose them all for just twenty runs, with Broad taking six wickets in the innings, and the match slipped\nfrom our grasp.\nAfter failing to win the second Test from a position of strength, things gradually went from bad to\nworse.  The  pain  in  my  foot  was  not  going  away,  and  as  a  team  we  were  outplayed  yet  again  in  the\nThird Test, which did not start in the best of circumstances, with riots in Birmingham creating a very\ntense  atmosphere.  The  shopping  centre  next  to  our  hotel  was  vandalized  and  there  was  talk  of\ncancelling the tour. It was only after we were given an assurance that things were under control that\nthe match went ahead.\nIn fact, this was not the only time that off-the-field events threatened to disrupt the tour. Before the\none-day series, a match against Kent in Canterbury caused us all a lot of worry. In the closing stages\nof  the  game  we  noticed  a  large  number  of  security  personnel  hovering  near  the  dressing  room.  We\nwere told that a suspect package had been found on the team bus and the bomb squad were on their\nway.  Then  we  were  asked  to  go  and  wait  on  the  field  because  the  dressing  room  was  close  to  the\ndanger  area.  We  all  waited  patiently  until  we  were  finally  told  that  we  could  leave  by  the  back\nentrance of the ground. There was yet another bomb scare at night in the shopping arcade next to our\nhotel  and  a  number  of  the  players  were  starting  to  feel  anxious  about  our  security.  The  following\nmorning we were told that things were fully under control and eventually the tour continued.\nIn the third Test at Edgbaston, England won the match with their first-innings total of 710, which\nincluded a career-best 294 from Alastair Cook and 104 from Eoin Morgan. I was pleased to bat well in\nthe second innings and I don’t think anyone would deny I was unlucky to get out for 40. MS Dhoni had\nplayed  a  straight  drive  off  Graeme  Swann  and  the  ball  hit  Swann’s  hand  and  ricocheted  onto  the\nstumps at the non-striker’s end, running me out. With nothing going our way, we headed to The Oval\nfor  the  fourth  and  final  Test  very  low  on  morale.  What  was  worse  was  that  we  had  also  lost  our\nnumber-one ranking in the process, having lost three Test matches on the trot.\nStuck on ninety-nine\nI  had  scored  my  ninety-eighth  international  hundred  on  27  February  2011  while  playing  England  in\nour second World Cup game in Bangalore, but there was no mention of the 100th hundred in the media\nat that stage. Less than two weeks later, I scored the ninety-ninth against South Africa at Nagpur, but\nstill  no  one  brought  up  the  100th.  The  topic  did  come  up  on  television  when  I  was  in  the  eighties\nagainst  Pakistan  in  the  World  Cup  semi-final,  but  that  was  no  more  than  a  passing  mention.  It  was\nonly after the World Cup win that the media needed a new cause to obsess over and the 100th hundred\nfitted the bill: it had never been achieved before, it made for good television and newsprint and it was\na  landmark  fans  could  be  proud  of.  It  was  a  recipe  for  unprecedented  frenzy  –  without  always\nappreciating the impact it might have on me.\nI first became aware of all the fuss when I was on a family holiday in England in June 2011 before\nthe Test series. I was asked if I had deliberately skipped the West Indies tour to ensure that the 100th\nhundred came at Lord’s in the first Test. I did not have a Test hundred at Lord’s (and now never will\nhave) and this, I was informed, was my way of setting the record straight. Only, it was news to me. I\nwould, of course, have been delighted to get the hundred at Lord’s, but hundreds simply do not happen\nas easily as that.\nThe obsession soon turned into hysteria. Every time I went in to bat, I was supposed to get to the\nlandmark hundred. Believe me, I wanted to get it out of the way. I was spending hours at the nets and\nfelt good about my batting, but gradually the 100th ton was starting to play on my mind.\nAt The Oval in the fourth and final Test, which started on 18 August, England scored 591 in their\nfirst innings, with 235 from Ian Bell and another century from Pietersen. We were bowled out for 300\nin reply and asked to follow on. I was dismissed for 23 in our first innings, trying to play a sweep shot\nto Graeme Swann, and was extremely angry at getting out that way. My mood wasn’t helped by the\nfact that earlier I had been hit on my left shoulder by a ball from Stuart Broad and scans later revealed\na tear.\nI was keen to make amends in the second innings when I went in at the fall of our second wicket\nwith an hour of play left on day four. There was a patch of rough created by the left-arm seamer RP\nSingh outside the right-hander’s off stump and while batting against Graeme Swann I decided to take\nan off-stump guard to negate the impact of the rough. The strategy paid off and I was able to negotiate\nthe last hour with relative ease. Resuming on 35 the next day, I focused on the thought of returning to\nthe dressing room after batting all day to save the match.\nAmit Mishra, our leg-spin googly bowler, was batting with me and we were both conscious that the\nfirst  hour  on  the  final  day  was  critical,  with  the  English  attack  led  by  James  Anderson  bowling\nsuperbly  in  home  conditions. Amit,  the  nightwatchman,  was  resolute  in  protecting  his  wicket  and  I\nwalked up to him at the end of every over to tell him that he should bat as if it was our last wicket.\nI managed to hit a few good boundaries and began to feel I was getting a grip on proceedings. We\nsaw off Anderson and the first hour went more or less to plan. Stuart Broad and Swann took over but\nwe  continued  our  resistance  and  got  to  lunch  without  losing  a  wicket.  We  had  won  the  session  and\nscored 87 runs in the process. I was on 72 and Amit had played superbly for his 57.\nOn resumption, I kept telling Amit that he should focus on getting another 50 runs. Every run was\ngetting us closer to the England total. I was on 91 when Amit was finally bowled by Swann for 84. We\nwere just 29 adrift of the English total and the partnership had put on 144 for the fourth wicket. We\nhad almost managed to play out the first hour after lunch and there was a good chance of saving the\ngame  if  we  batted  well  for  three  more  hours. And  that’s  when  I  got  out  for  91.  I  was  standing  well\noutside my crease and the ball from Tim Bresnan came back a long way to hit my pads as I tried to\nplay it to midwicket. While batting, you can usually sense the trajectory of the ball and there was little\ndoubt in my mind that the drift would have taken the ball past the leg stump, so I was surprised to see\numpire Rod Tucker raise his finger.\nA sense of helplessness descended on me. All the good work of the morning had been undone and it\nwas going to be difficult to save the match with so many overs left in the day. The decision, replays\nshowed, was not the best; luck, a key ingredient in cricket, had once again deserted me. When I met\numpire Tucker later in the year he jokingly suggested to me that his friends were not happy with the\ndecision and had given him a lot of grief for it. It was good of him to come and speak to me and we\nboth decided to forget it and move on.\nThe Test series was followed by a five-match one-day series and I was looking to carry forward the\nform I had shown at The Oval. Just then, my shoulder injury really started to bother me again. Even\nwhen I was resting during the two Twenty20 matches, it showed no signs of settling down and I was\nforced to have an ultrasound-guided injection in the shoulder joint. It was in Durham on the eve of the\nfirst ODI that my toe also started to play up again during training. I did everything possible to settle\nthe  pain  and  took  a  few  anti-inflammatory  pills  at  night,  but  they  didn’t  help  and  I  woke  the  next\nmorning feeling worse. I was feeling worried when we left the hotel on our way to the ground and as\nsoon as we reached the stadium I asked Ashish Kaushik to strap my foot. The moment I stepped down\nfrom  his  physio  table  onto  the  hard  tiles  I  suspected  I  was  in  trouble.  When  I  tried  getting  into  my\nspikes,  I  knew  I  couldn’t  play. At  the  end  of  the  second  Test  match  I  had  not  been  able  to  think  of\nmissing a game. Now the pain was such that I could not think of playing a game.\nWe decided to go to London for a fresh set of scans. I was given two injections in the sole of my\nfoot and I must say they were two of the most painful injections I have had in my life. The doctors\nthen informed me that I needed to rest my foot for five to six weeks. I finally started training again on\nthe eve of the three-Test series against the West Indies at home in November 2011.\nAs soon as I resumed practice, the clamour for the 100th hundred started again.\nWest Indies in India, November–December 2011\nBy November 2011, the pressure had really started to get to me. Every day I was getting a lot of text\nmessages wishing me well for the century and asking me not to worry. They were sent with the best of\nintentions, but unfortunately they made it impossible for me not to think about the landmark all the\ntime.  Everywhere  I  went  people  were  talking  about  it  –  in  hotels,  restaurants,  planes  and  airport\nlounges. While it was touching to see the affection, at times it began to get quite unbearable. It was\ndifficult to cope with all the words of sympathy and reassurance and the looks on people’s faces day\nafter day.\nWhile  recuperating  from  the  toe  injury  under  the  supervision  of  physio  Harshada  Rajadhyaksha,\nwho has helped me for over a decade, I had started to mentally prepare myself for the visit of the West\nIndies. It was important for the team to put the England slump behind us, especially as we had another\ntough tour of Australia lined up for the end of the year. Preparation was important because the West\nIndies  attack,  with  Fidel  Edwards,  Ravi  Rampaul,  Kemar  Roach  and  Darren  Sammy,  was  not  the\neasiest to face, a fact that became all too clear at Delhi in the first Test, which started on 6 November.\nContrary to the general expectation that we would roll the West Indies over, we were bowled out for\n209 in our first innings at Delhi and conceded a lead of 95 to the tourists. Though our bowlers did well\nto bowl them out for 180 in the second innings, with Ashwin taking six wickets, we were confronted\nwith a tricky chase of 276 to win the game. I went out to bat with our score at 95–2 and was eventually\nout with just 30 runs needed for victory. I had scored 76 and was delighted to have helped us take a 1–\n0 lead in the series.\nFans  and  critics,  however,  were  not  quite  so  pleased. As  far  as  they  were  concerned,  I  had  fallen\ntwenty-four  runs  short  and  the  headline  was  ‘Sachin  fails  again’.  The  hundred  had  turned  into  a\nfixation and people were starting to calculate my scores backwards from 100. I don’t think it had ever\nhappened to a cricketer before and deep down it started to get to me. As the wait continued, a section\nof  the  media  started  making  things  even  more  difficult.  They  suggested  that  I  was  only  playing  to\nachieve  personal  milestones.  It  was  a  strange  paradox.  Here  I  was  in  Delhi  scoring  76  and  helping\nIndia to victory, yet I was criticized for playing for selfish reasons.\nThree  Indian  batsmen  made  centuries  in  our  only  innings  in  the  second  Test  at  Eden  Gardens  in\nKolkata starting on 14 November, but unfortunately I wasn’t one of them. Laxman was unbeaten on\n176,  while  Rahul  made  119  and  Dhoni  144  in  our  total  of  631.  My  contribution  was  only  38.  Our\nbowlers then dismissed the West Indies twice to give us a win by an innings and 15 runs.\nThe final Test in Mumbai started on 22 November and the West Indies dashed our hopes of a 3–0\nwhitewash  by  posting  590  in  their  first  innings,  with  Darren  Bravo  making  166  and  their  first  six\nbatsmen  all  making  fifties. At  the  end  of  the  third  day  I  was  not  out  on  67  in  our  first  innings  and\nplaying well. Could I really make that elusive 100th hundred on my home ground?\nOn our way to the ground on the morning of the fourth day, the number of outside-broadcast vans\nlined  up  opposite  the  stadium  was  staggering  and  that’s  when  I  realized  this  was  a  very  different\noccasion  from  normal.  Darren  Sammy,  the  West  Indies  captain,  took  the  second  new  ball  and\nimmediately  there  was  some  movement  for  both  Fidel  Edwards  and  Ravi  Rampaul.  I  was  standing\noutside the crease to counter the movement and told myself not to chase any balls outside off stump\nwhile the ball was swinging. I started the day well by flicking Rampaul for four in the very first over,\nfollowing it up with a punch off Edwards through cover. I then produced an upper cut over slip for six\nagainst Edwards and was just seven short of the hundred.\nJust then, I looked at the scoreboard and started to feel distinctly strange. My feet were heavy and it\nwas as if I had no strength left. I had never felt as nervous in my career, not even when I had been\nabout to make my first Test hundred in 1990. I walked away towards square leg and took a few deep\nbreaths.  I  kept  telling  myself  to  concentrate  hard  and  not  lose  focus.  It  was  a  sensation  I  had  never\nexperienced before.\nMy ninety-fourth run was a single to deep point. In the next over from Rampaul, I played the last\nthree balls after Virat had taken a single off the third delivery. The fourth ball was full and I played it\nto  cover,  moving  well  to  the  pitch  of  the  ball  and  negating  any  possible  movement.  The  next  ball\nbounced a little but I managed to play it down with soft hands. Rampaul was trying to get the ball to\nmove away and I needed to be watchful. The last ball of the over came in to me quicker and bounced a\nlittle more than I anticipated and the shot travelled quickly to Sammy at second slip, who held a good\ncatch. It all happened within a fraction of a second and only when I glanced back did I realize that I\nwas out.\nThe  realization  was  exceedingly  painful.  I  had  come  within  one  shot  of  the  century.  But  you  can\nnever take anything for granted in the game, and that’s part of its beauty. I was still dazed as I walked\nback to the pavilion, trying to take in the applause of a very appreciative crowd. The wait would have\nto continue and the pressure was bound to become even more intense in the days ahead.\nAfter the Test series, I decided to withdraw from the one-day series. There was speculation that it\nwas because I didn’t want to get the hundred in an ODI against the West Indies, but that had nothing to\ndo with it. My big toe had started to trouble me again. I was finding it difficult to change direction\nwhile running and simply could not cope with the pressure of one-day cricket. I knew I needed to do\nsomething about it before the next Test series in Australia.\nIndia in Australia, December 2011–February 2012\nI left for Australia on 8 December to get acclimatized to the conditions and be fully prepared for the\nBoxing Day Test in Melbourne. The injury hadn’t disappeared completely and I went to a podiatrist to\nget the toe examined again. When I tried out some new insoles, the experiment actually made things\nworse and I had to go back to my old ones, but that was when I came up with the idea of using corn\ncaps. These were cut in the shape of doughnuts and filled with jelly, and were placed right underneath\nthe toe to absorb the pressure of the spikes. They seemed to work to a certain extent. The first time we\nhad to apply the strapping, it took about forty-five minutes, because we were still figuring out exactly\nhow to do it so that the padding stayed in the same place throughout the day. Within a week it was\ntaking  twenty  minutes  and  soon  I  was  doing  the  strapping  myself  in  my  own  room,  so  that  I  didn’t\nhave to start every day in the physio’s room. Every night during Test matches, I would get the tape\nready and cut it to the exact size. That way I got a few extra minutes in the morning and wasn’t so\nrushed.\nIn  the  Boxing  Day  Test  at  the  MCG  we  started  extremely  well,  bowling Australia  out  for  333  in\ntheir first innings, In our reply, I came in when the score was 97–2 and found that I was moving as\nwell as I had done in years and I was able to play all my shots. For example, in the first over after tea I\nwas in complete control against Peter Siddle, the leader of their attack. After hitting the first ball for\nsix  over  third  man,  I  flicked  him  for  three  runs  the  very  next  ball.  In  the  thirty-fifth  over  of  our\ninnings,  I  hit  him  for  two  consecutive  fours,  the  second  of  which  was  a  cover  drive  I  particularly\nremember. The ball was pitched slightly outside off stump and I sent it racing to the boundary.\nI was playing aggressively and followed up the Siddle cover drive with another off Ben Hilfenhaus.\nHe tried to compensate and bowled a full delivery to me in the same over and I played a straight drive\npast mid on for yet another four. I had reached 32 off twenty-nine balls. It was just the kind of start I\nwanted and it was time for consolidation. I managed to get to my fifty off just fifty-five deliveries and\nthe momentum had swung our way.\nWhen I look back at this innings, I have little doubt that I was batting as well as I could have done.\nIf I had managed to survive the last over of the second day, the entire series might have been different,\nbut I was out for 73 to a Siddle delivery that moved in late after pitching, forcing me to play away\nfrom my body. My wicket gave the Australians an opening and they did very well to capitalize on the\nopportunity on the third morning.\nAnjali  and  the  kids  were  in  Melbourne  at  the  time  and  it  would  have  been  fantastic  to  get  the\nhundred there after batting so well. Rahul was out in the first over the next morning and Laxman and\nDhoni followed soon after, handing Australia control of the match. I was so disappointed after getting\nout  that  I  sought  solace  in  food  that  night  when  I  went  out  for  dinner  with Anjali,  the  kids  and  my\nmother-in-law. Not only did I end up eating two huge main courses in frustration but, to add to my\nwoes, I also lost my credit card.\nWe  struck  back  in  the Australian  second  innings  and  reduced  them  to  27–4,  with  Umesh Yadav\ntaking three of those wickets. Then Ponting and Michael Hussey came together in what turned out to\nbe  a  game-breaking  partnership  of  115.  We  had  one  final  opportunity  when  Hussey  was  out  on  the\nfourth morning for 89, reducing Australia to 197–9. At that point the lead was less than 250 and we\nstill  had  a  realistic  chance  of  winning  the  match.  But  a  43-run  last-wicket  partnership  between\nHilfenhaus and Pattinson took it out of our reach and Australia went 1–0 up in the series.\nThe Sydney Test was even more disappointing. The wicket had a lot of grass and Australia won the\ntoss and decided to bowl, which is unusual for an Australian team at home. They took full advantage\nof the conditions and bowled us out for only 191 on the first day. I scored 41 before dragging a James\nPattinson delivery on to my stumps. We did well at the start of the Australian innings and had them at\n37–3, but then we lost our way. Batting in much-improved conditions on days two and three, Australia\nwent on to run up a very big score, with skipper Michael Clarke contributing a triple hundred to their\n659, and this left us two whole days to bat to save the match.\nBatting for two days was difficult but not impossible. At the end of day three, I was unbeaten on\neight,  having  faced  forty  deliveries.  I  was  batting  to  a  plan  and  was  determined  to  leave  everything\noutside off stump. It had got a little cloudy in the evening and with Ben Hilfenhaus and Peter Siddle\nbowling  really  well,  I  was  satisfied  to  survive  the  last  hour  so  that  I  could  resume  the  following\nmorning.\nBefore I walked out to bat on the fourth day, our masseur Amit Shah wished me luck and I said to\nhim that he should get ready to keep me going for two days. I knew that if I did so I would be able to\nsave the game, and if the 100th ton should come along the way, so much the better. Once again I was\nbatting well and should have gone on, but infuriatingly I got myself out to part-time left-arm spinner\nMichael  Clarke  for  80  to  a  ball  which  pitched  around  off  stump  on  a  fourth-day  pitch  with  a  few\ncracks and, just as I was trying to play forward, kissed the outside edge of my bat and hit Brad Haddin\non his thigh before going to Mike Hussey at slip.\nIt was a soft dismissal. I had actually told myself to wait an over before starting to attack Clarke,\nwho was bowling with a semi-defensive field. A very strong wind was blowing and I wanted to wait\nfor it to die down before I risked stepping out and hitting him over mid off. It was just one of those\nmoments  in  the  game  that  you  are  not  able  to  control,  moments  that  make  cricket  one  of  the  most\nchallenging of all sports.\nDespite scoring 73, 32, 41 and 80 in the first four innings in Australia, the talk about me ‘failing’\nhad resumed and the consensus among the critics was that I was getting out because I was thinking too\nmuch about the 100th hundred. Such comments were sometimes hard to take, because for me playing\nfor my country has always come first. The critics were welcome to give their opinions, but none of\nthem  had  ever  been  in  my  predicament  and  it  was  impossible  for  them  to  understand  what  I  was\nthinking or feeling.\nAfter Sydney, the series went steadily downhill for us at Perth and Adelaide. We should have played\nmuch  better  and  I  must  say  the  eight-Test-match  losing  streak  on  foreign  soil  was  very  difficult  to\ncome  to  terms  with.  Our  team  had  not  lived  up  to  its  potential  and  had  been  outplayed  in  all\ndepartments. It was a very trying time.\nMy  toe  was  continuing  to  pose  problems  and  mentally  I  was  frustrated.  It  was  then  that  a  foot\nspecialist  suggested  to  me  that  I  should  have  an  operation  on  both  my  sesamoid  bones.  In  my\nfrustration,  I  almost  agreed  and  was  ready  to  be  on  crutches  for  the  next  four  months,  but  Anjali\ndissuaded  me  from  doing  so,  and  in  fact  spoke  to  Prof.  Cathy  Speed  in  London,  who  advised  that  I\nshould avoid surgery. Anjali then came all the way to Australia for just two days to spend some time\nwith me because she was worried that I would go ahead with the surgery out of frustration. I am glad I\nlistened to her and that good sense prevailed.\nAfter  the  Test  series  there  was  widespread  speculation  that  I  had  made  myself  available  for  the\nsubsequent limited-overs tri-series against Sri Lanka and Australia just so that I could score my 100th\ncentury. Such statements were frustrating because they were simply untrue. One of the main reasons I\nplayed  in  the  series  was  that  MS  Dhoni  came  and  said  to  me,  ‘Aap  rukh  jao.  Aap  rahoge  to  achha\nhoga. Aap agar sab match na bhi khelte ho phir bhi aap rukh jao.’ (Please stay. It will be good if you\nstay. Even if you don’t play all the games, please stay.) Perhaps it’s difficult for some to understand\nthe obsessive urge to do well for India, but this is what has given my sporting life a purpose.\nDespite  playing  well  in  patches,  however,  we  didn’t  make  it  to  the  final  of  the  tri-series.  There\nseemed  to  be  a  cloud  of  negativity  surrounding  the  game  and  fans  were  starting  to  lose  faith  in  the\nteam. We needed to get things moving again and the next opportunity to do so was in the Asia Cup in\nBangladesh in March 2012.\nTry, try, try again …\nI scored only six in our first Asia Cup game, a 50-run victory against Sri Lanka in Dhaka on 13 March\n2012, and the ‘Sachin fails again’ cry started up immediately. Fortunately I was not particularly aware\nof it at the time, though, as my family and friends did their best to shield me from what appeared in\nthe press.\nOur next match was against Bangladesh on 16 March on a track that was slightly slower than the\none  used  against  Sri  Lanka.  The  ball  did  not  always  come  on  to  the  bat  and  it  was  going  to  be\nimportant to pace the innings and set a big score for the hosts to chase down. Virat and I rotated the\nstrike  well  and  the  scoring  rate  hovered  just  above  the  five-runs-an-over  mark  for  the  most  of  the\ninnings. We had set ourselves a target of 280–90 and were on course to achieve it.\nAs I passed 80, the pressure started to build and I began to feel the burden of the hundred again. I\ndid my best to put it out of my mind, but it was a truly difficult and frustrating period. I remember an\nover against Mashrafe Mortaza during the batting powerplay in which three shots I played should have\ngone for four. They were stopped by some really good fielding or they went straight to the fielders. On\nanother day, I could have taken 12 from the over. On that day, I got nothing.\nI had to counter the building pressure and somehow I played a shot for four when I was on 90 that\ncalmed my nerves a little. Meanwhile Suresh Raina, who had come in to bat after Virat, was finding\nthe boundary consistently, keeping the scoring rate up. I was now on 94 and, with another single in the\nsame over, had come the closest to a hundred for a year.\nIn the forty-first over I took three more singles and was left needing just two more runs. They were\nperhaps  the  two  most  difficult  runs  of  my  career.  Despite  having  scored  ninety-nine  international\nhundreds, I had experienced nothing like it. Determination, anxiety, relief – all of these feelings came\ntogether. I kept telling myself to stay focused and play each ball on merit. It was time to go back to\nbasics and rely on skills I had practised all my life.\nWhen I got to 99 by driving Shakib-al-Hasan to long off, I told myself that the situation demanded\npatience and it was no time for heroics. Shakib was getting the ball to spin and so when I faced him\nnext I stepped out just a little to smother the turn. As the ball trundled to square leg, I jogged to my\n100th international century.\nI instantly felt drained. I removed my helmet and pointed to the flag on the front, indicating that I\nhad  done  it  for  India.  Then  I  looked  at  my  bat  and  asked  God  why  it  had  taken  so  long  when  my\ncommitment  had  been  steadfast  throughout.  More  than  anything,  I  was  relieved.  As  I  patted  the\ntricolour on my helmet with my bat, I felt a tremendous sense of satisfaction. It gave me a sense of\nfulfilment that the first player to achieve the feat of scoring 100 international hundreds was an Indian.\nFriends often say to me that my celebrations that day seemed rather muted. I remind them that I had\nbeen  like  that  for  over  two  decades.  I  have  always  preferred  to  be  restrained,  except  on  a  few  rare\noccasions.  This  is  not  to  say  I  wasn’t  proud.  Of  course  I  was.  When  I  first  played  for  India  against\nPakistan in 1989, I had never imagined I would still be playing for the country in 2012, let alone score\n100 centuries.\nUnfortunately,  we  went  on  to  lose  the  match.  Bangladesh  played  really  well  to  chase  down  a\nchallenging score of 289, with Tamim Iqbal, Jahurul Islam and Nasir Hossain all making fifties and\nShakib-Al-Hasan and Mushfiqur Rahim getting very close. I was amazed to hear some people say we\nshould have got a few more runs to be safe, as 289 wasn’t a bad score on that pitch, considering that\nwe had restricted a much better Sri Lankan batting line-up to 254 in their run chase in the previous\nmatch on a better batting pitch. Sometimes you have to give the opposition credit and on this occasion\nthe Bangladeshis played really well.\nWhile we were all disappointed at losing the match, my team-mates were extremely happy for me.\nIt was gratifying to see such powerful emotion within the team. This is what one plays for, the respect\nand affection of one’s team-mates, and I was touched to hear the sentiments expressed in the dressing\nroom.\nAfter finishing a rather long press conference, it was time to speak to Anjali and the children. They\nwere holidaying in Goa and were having dinner at Martins, one of my favourite seafood restaurants,\nwhen I first spoke to them. They were extremely happy and relieved at the same time. My family had\nalso been feeling the effects of the pressure and now they felt a sense of liberation. It was only natural\nthat I should dedicate the hundred to my brother Ajit, who has spent a life making me the cricketer I\nam.  My  mother  was  in  our  house  in  Mumbai  and  was  extremely  thrilled  to  watch  me  score  the\nhundred. I could sense the joy in her voice. Though I was not around to see my mother’s face, I could\npicture  her  and  imagine  what  she  must  be  feeling.  Sensing  her  delight  gave  me  a  feeling  of\ncontentment that is difficult to describe. Suffice to say I was a very proud son.\nWhen I got back to India, I was overwhelmed at the reception and wish to put on record my deepest\ngratitude to everyone who had prayed for me. The event organized by Mukesh and Nita Ambani, the\nowners of the Mumbai Indians, was fantastic, and to hear the legendary Lata Mangeshkar sing for me\nwas an unbelievable experience. These are moments I will never forget, moments that more than made\nup for the year of frustration.\nFeeling 50 kilos lighter\nWe were still involved in the Asia Cup and were due to play Pakistan in Dhaka a couple of days later.\nI  was  suddenly  feeling  a  lot  more  relaxed  and  was  looking  forward  to  batting  in  what  is  always  a\nspecial game for an Indian cricketer, wherever it’s played.\nWhen I was interviewed by the former Pakistani captain Ramiz Raja, I suggested to him that I was\nfeeling 50 kilos lighter. In reality it was a little more. The desperation had vanished and it was time to\nenjoy  batting  again.  Life,  it  seemed,  was  finally  back  to  normal. A  number  of  journalists  asked  me\nwhat I was thinking after scoring the 100th ton. I jokingly said to them that I was thinking that I had\nscored ninety-nine centuries before but everyone seemed to have forgotten about them when trying to\ngive me advice about how to bat. Then someone asked me, ‘What were you thinking when you scored\nyour first Test hundred in 1990?’ I said to him that I was thinking that there were ninety-nine still to\ngo!\nI  felt  completely  different  when  I  went  out  to  open  the  batting  against  Pakistan,  trying  to  chase\ndown  a  formidable  score  of  329.  We  lost  Gautam  Gambhir  in  the  first  over,  but  Virat  and  I  batted\nfreely and put together a 133-run stand at almost seven runs an over. We set up the chase and when I\nwas out for 52, Virat and Rohit finished off the job in style, with Virat ending up with a brilliant 183.\nThe  innings  against  Pakistan  put  into  perspective  how  difficult  the  wait  had  been  and  how  much\npressure I had been under. Despite trying not to think about the 100th hundred, I hadn’t been able to\nescape  the  tension  that  had  built  up.  Finally  I  felt  liberated  and,  more  importantly,  the  media’s\nobsession  had  been  satisfied.  Maybe  now  I  would  be  allowed  to  concentrate  on  my  batting.  For  the\ntime being, there was a rare period of calm, and I was desperate to make the most of it.\nIndia in England 2011 – The Pataudi Trophy\n1st Test.

            "title": "MY LAST FULL SEASON\n",
            "data": "With the 100th hundred finally out of the way, I was looking forward to a busy season of Test cricket\nat  home.  For  once,  we  were  not  touring  much  and  in  2012–13  we  were  due  to  host  New  Zealand,\nEngland  and Australia. You  don’t  often  get  to  play  ten  uninterrupted  Test  matches  at  home.  I  had\nprepared well but must concede things rarely went to plan from a personal point of view. In the lead-\nup to the season I continued to be bothered by the toe injury, so much so that I visited BKS Iyengar,\none of the foremost yoga gurus in the world, together with Zaheer Khan for a day in May 2012, during\nthe  fifth  edition  of  the  IPL.  I  had  been  introduced  to  Guruji  in  1999  by  Kiran  More  when  I  was\nsuffering  from  the  back  injury  and  had  spent  a  week  with  him  in  Pune  at  the  time.  In  June  2012  I\ntravelled to Germany to the Adidas factory to get some special shoes made and during this visit I was\naccompanied by Prof. Cathy Speed, who had travelled from London to be with me.\nIn August 2012, we won both Tests against New Zealand, with Ravichandran Ashwin and Pragyan\nOjha bowling well and getting us wickets at regular intervals. In each of my three innings in the series,\nI got a start before being bowled, which prompted a lot of speculation in the press about my technique\n– had my reflexes slowed down and was I the batsman I once was? In my mind, however, there was\nnothing seriously wrong with my technique or my approach. One problem, perhaps, was that in the off\nseason I had trained a lot indoors and had got too used to the high indoor bounce. In Hyderabad in the\nfirst  Test,  for  example,  I  was  dismissed  for  19  by  a  delivery  from  Trent  Boult  that  I  expected  to\nbounce more.\nI travelled to the second Test match in Bangalore determined to play a big innings. However, this\ntime round I was bowled for 17 by a ball from the right-arm fast bowler Doug Bracewell that didn’t\nswing as much as expected and continued going straight. When I went out to bat in the second innings\nI tried to play myself in, hoping that spending some time at the crease would help. I managed to hit a\nfew fours before getting out for 27 to a Tim Southee delivery that swung back in to knock me over.\nIt  was  not  the  best  start  to  the  season,  but  I  put  it  behind  me  and  focused  my  attention  on  the\nEngland  series  that  started  in  November  2012. As  part  of  the  preparation  I  played  for  Mumbai  in  a\nRanji  Trophy  game  against  Railways  on  2  November.  In  my  one  innings,  I  had  to  battle  physical\nexhaustion, as I had had serious food poisoning just before the game and was feeling extremely weak;\nso  much  so,  in  fact,  that  I  asked  Rohit  Sharma  to  bat  ahead  of  me.  By  the  time  I  went  in,  I  had\nrecovered  enough  to  make  137,  which  was  a  very  satisfying  knock  considering  how  I’d  felt  a  few\nhours earlier. Suddenly I was playing my shots and feeling positive again.\nEngland in India, November–December 2012\nI  thought  I  started  well  against  England  in  the  first  Test  at Ahmedabad  on  15  November.  My  body\nposition and balance were perfect and I was getting into a really good rhythm. From the off, I played\nsome cracking strokes, including a very pleasing lofted shot against Swann over midwicket. I set out\nto  bat  aggressively  and  not  hold  myself  back,  because  that  was  how  I  had  scored  the  Ranji  Trophy\nhundred. Seeing me go over the short midwicket fielder, Swann pushed a man back and I decided to\ncounter him by going over mid on. The ball had drift, however, and instead of playing it over mid on, I\nhit  it  straight  to  the  midwicket  fielder  and  I  was  out  for  13.  I  was  very  angry  with  myself  for  not\nmaking the most of my good form.\nIn  the  context  of  the  match,  my  failure  in  Ahmedabad  did  not  matter  in  the  end,  with  Sehwag\nmaking  117  and  Cheteshwar  Pujara  going  on  to  score  an  excellent  double  century.  He  paced  his\ninnings  beautifully  and  has  the  temperament  and  the  patience  to  be  a  top-class  Test  batsman  in  the\nyears to come. He has all the shots and is a much-improved player since his debut against Australia in\n2010. Pragyan Ojha and Ravi Ashwin then got in on the act and ran through England in both innings.\nThe second Test started in Mumbai on 23 November and rather unexpectedly England turned things\naround  on  the  first  day.  I  had  always  been  worried  about  the  Mumbai  match  and  had  shared  my\nconcerns with coach Duncan Fletcher. I felt that the pace and bounce of the Wankhede wicket would\nhelp the England bowlers. England had beaten us at the Wankhede in 2006 and I thought we should\nhave prepared a good batting wicket instead of a turner.\nThe inclusion of Monty Panesar in the team was an inspired selection and I got out to him on the\nfirst morning before lunch for eight, to a ball that spun from leg stump to hit the top of my off stump.\nNobody expects the ball to turn square at the Wankhede in the first session of the first day of a Test.\nNot only that but, when Monty was bowling, I had chatted with Pujara, who was batting at the other\nend, and he said the ball was not turning at all. I had scored thousands of runs playing the shot I tried\nagainst Monty. When there’s not much turn you can just smother the spin and turn a ball pitched on\nleg stump to square leg for a single, but the shot isn’t on if there’s vicious turn. It was just my luck\nthat it was the first delivery that spun square. I was gutted at having failed in front of my home crowd.\nMonty  had  taken  Sehwag’s  wicket  earlier  in  the  innings  and  triggered  a  rare  batting  collapse  on\nhome soil, which handed England control of the match. Only Pujara, who scored a brilliant 135, stood\nup against the English spinners, Panesar and Swann, and we squandered the advantage of winning the\ntoss and batting first.\nEngland then batted excellently, with skipper Alastair Cook and Kevin Pietersen playing extremely\nwell in difficult batting conditions to set up the game. Cook made 122 and Pietersen an imperious 186.\nThey  were  instrumental  in  giving  their  team  a  first-innings  lead  of  86.  Cook  showed  great  patience\nand throughout the series played spin better than most visiting batsmen have done in recent times.\nIn the second innings, I again got out to Monty Panesar. This time the ball came on with the arm\nwhile I played for turn. Gautam Gambhir was batting at the other end and at the end of the day’s play,\nhe  told  me  that,  as  I  was  walking  back  to  the  pavilion,  Monty  had  said  to  Gautam,  ‘Ball  apne  aap\nseedha nikal gaya!’  (The  delivery  went  straight  on  its  own!)  I  was  out  fair  and  square,  but  couldn’t\nhelp feeling unlucky to get out to an arm-ball that wasn’t even intended by the bowler! To add to the\nfrustration,  we  lost  the  match  in  under  four  days.  Losing  at  home  was  not  something  we  were\naccustomed to and it came as something of a rude jolt.\nI realized that I needed to take my mind off cricket for a while, so I called Yuvi, Zaheer and Bhajji\nand suggested that we should watch a movie in the hotel room on reaching Kolkata for the third Test. I\nhad already seen Barfi! – an award-winning film about a deaf mute – but it was so good that I really\nwanted to watch it again. Forty-five minutes into the film Bhajji said, ‘Paaji yeh log kuch bolenge ki\nfilm aise hi chalta rahega?’ (Brother, are they going to say anything or is it going to continue in this\nsilent vein for the whole movie?) Only Harbhajan could have come out with something like that!\nAfter a string of failures, I decided to change my approach in the third Test in Kolkata, starting on 5\nDecember 2012. I would stop being aggressive and instead play within myself, even though it was a\nreally good batting pitch. Because of this defensive mind-set I missed out on a number of balls that in\nnormal circumstances I would have put away for four, but I was mindful that I had done something\nsimilar in Australia in 2003–04 when I had scored a double hundred. This time I managed 76 before\ngetting  out  to  a  good  delivery  from  James Anderson  straight  after  a  drinks  break. Anderson  bowled\nbeautifully  throughout  the  series  and  was  the  central  figure  in  the  English  attack.  He  used  reverse\nswing well and picked up wickets at critical moments.\nYet again we had failed to make the most of our opportunities and we were all out for a modest 316.\nEngland were brilliant in response and Cook again led from the front with a spectacular 190. A skipper\nleading from the front is always good for a team and England put us under pressure again with a 207-\nrun lead. Our second innings was nothing to write home about and I got out for five, caught at slip off\nGraeme Swann. None of the batsmen played to their potential and we lost the Test in four days.\nWe went to Nagpur for the last Test on 13 December 2012, needing a win to draw the series. Virat\nKohli made a hundred and Dhoni was run out on 99, but my poor series continued as I was bowled by\nJames Anderson for two in my only innings. It seemed that things were just not going my way and as I\nwent  into  bat,  I  faced  two  balls  from  Monty  Panesar  that  spun  viciously.  Till  then  the  wicket  had\nappeared flat and even the England players were surprised. That’s what seems to happen when you’re\ngoing through a bad patch. Trott made a hundred in England’s second innings and the game ended in a\ndraw, meaning that we had lost the series 2–1.\nEngland were easily the better team in the series but I must say I was terribly disappointed with the\nway I performed in the six innings I played in those four Test matches. Anjali had actually come to\nNagpur  because  my  frame  of  mind  was  not  good  and  when  the  press  saw  that  she  was  there,  they\nassumed  that  I  was  going  to  announce  my  retirement.  Something  that  helped  me  regain  some\nperspective  at  the  time  was  a  conversation  with  Ravi  Shastri.  Ravi  and  I  have  always  been  good\nfriends and in Nagpur we had dinner in my room and he repeatedly told me that I should not start to\ndoubt myself after a few failures. His confidence in me was reassuring and I greatly appreciated the\ngesture.\nTime for change\nI took some time off after the England series to clear my mind after all the scrutiny and speculation\nand to think carefully about my career. I gave retirement some serious thought, but I concluded that I\nstill had the hunger and runs left in me. I might not have made many runs in the England series, but\nthe way I was batting had given me enough confidence to carry on.\nOne-day cricket was another matter, and India were due to play three ODIs against Pakistan at the\nend  of  2012.  I  had  not  played  ODI  cricket  between  March  and  December  and  I  had  to  ask  myself\nwhether I was realistically going to take part in the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand in 2015.\nIf not, what goals would I have left in ODI cricket? I realized I had to accept that I was not going to be\naround  till  then.  The  next  question  was  whether  I  wanted  to  play  a  farewell  ODI  series  against\nPakistan before calling it a day. I decided that it was better to take a break and focus my energies on\nthe Australia Test series in February–March 2013.\nHaving informed the BCCI, the chairman of selectors and Duncan Fletcher of my decision to retire\nfrom ODIs, I boarded a flight for Dehradun on my way to Mussoorie, a quiet hill station in the North\nIndian state of Uttarakhand that I love to visit. A break in Mussoorie is a great way to escape from city\nlife and unwind, and that’s what I needed. The news of my retirement had become public while I was\nin  the  air  between  Mumbai  and  Delhi  and  as  soon  as  we  landed  in  Delhi  I  got  a  series  of  messages\nfrom friends and well-wishers. As the same aircraft was continuing on to Dehradun, I told Anjali that I\nwas going to sit with the captain in the cockpit while the new passengers boarded, as I didn’t feel like\nspeaking to anyone for the time being.\nI also asked Anjali if she would gently break the news of my decision to Arjun, as I was concerned\nabout how he would take it. Anjali later told me that she would never forget his reaction. He said that\nhe was sure I still had a lot of cricket left in me and there was no reason for me to retire, but when\nAnjali explained to him that the decision was final, he turned his face away and leaned his head on the\nwindow and a tear drop rolled down his cheek. Anjali and I both got very emotional when she told me\nthis.  Sara,  being  a  little  older,  said  that  she  would  miss  seeing  me  play  but  had  full  faith  in  my\ndecision. My children were growing up fast and it mattered to me that they were both by my side at a\ntime like this. Whenever they are with me, it always makes a huge difference to my well-being.\nMussoorie was a timely break. There was no one there except family and a few very close friends\nand I had some time to myself and a chance to think about my future. The media and fans allowed me\nthe privacy to do so and while I still followed Mumbai’s progress in the Ranji Trophy, I also managed\nto  switch  off  from  cricket  for  a  while.  I  played  table  tennis,  went  for  long  walks  and  relaxed  in  the\nevenings, and managed to get my sense of optimism back. When I started to feel the urge to resume\ntraining, I knew it was time to return to Mumbai.\nAustralia in India, February–March 2013\nI used to reach the Wankhede Stadium for training at around seven every morning, and for a while I\nwould  be  completely  alone  in  the  stadium.  On  some  days  trainer  Rahul  Patwardhan  would  join  me.\nThe early-morning dew coated the lush green outfield and I could feel the dampness on my feet as I\nran, leaving a trail behind me. When I looked up at the empty galleries I knew that this was where I\nbelonged. This was my refuge.\nI would jog and then run for a while and do my fitness drills before the groundsmen arrived. The\nMumbai  team  would  normally  turn  up  around  8.30  a.m.,  by  which  time  I  would  be  in  the  dressing\nroom  taking  a  breather.  Then  I  would  train  with  my  team-mates,  doing  my  regular  net  sessions  to\nprepare for the Ranji Trophy. In all my years of playing international cricket, I never resorted to short\ncuts and there was no question of changing that at the start of 2013.\nIn the Ranji Trophy we beat Baroda and Services on the way to the final against Saurashtra, which\nwe won by an innings and 125 runs. Mumbai then took on the Rest of India in the Irani Cup game, in\nwhich I got a hundred. It was an innings that gave me a lot of satisfaction and confidence going into\nthe Test series.\nWe started the first of four Tests against Australia on 22 February at the Chepauk in Chennai, one\nof  my  favourite  grounds. Australia  did  well  to  make  380  in  the  first  innings,  with  skipper  Michael\nClarke contributing a hundred. In reply, we didn’t start well, losing two quick wickets for 12 runs, and\nwhen I walked to the wicket we badly needed a partnership.\nJames  Pattinson  was  bowling  fast  and  I  decided  to  take  the  battle  to  him  and  play  my  shots.  The\nfirst ball was slightly wide of off stump and I presented the full face of the blade and was happy to see\nthe ball race past the fielders to the boundary. I repeated the shot to the second ball and the result, to\nmy delight, was the same. The final ball of the over was short of a length and I moved inside the line\nto  flick  it  to  fine  leg  for  another  four.  I  had  hit  three  boundaries  in  four  balls  and  the  pressure  had\neased. My comeback had started well.\nCheteshwar Pujara, who batted sensibly for his 44, kept me company and I was unbeaten on 71 at\nthe end of the second day, confident of kicking on and getting a big hundred. However, it didn’t turn\nout that way as I was bowled for 81 by the off-spinner Nathan Lyon on the third morning with a ball\nthat was slightly fuller in length than I expected. I had made up my mind to get to the pitch of the ball\nand hit it between midwicket and long on with the turn. It was only when I realized that the length was\nfull that I quickly changed my shot and that was my downfall.\nThankfully,  the  dismissal  did  not  affect  the  team’s  momentum,  with  Virat  getting  a  hundred  and\nDhoni a blistering double hundred, one of the best innings I have seen at the Chepauk, to give us a lead\nof 192. Our spinners, led by Ashwin, then ran through the Australians in the second innings, leaving us\nneeding just 50 to win the match. In my second innings, I played the same shot to Nathan Lyon’s first\ntwo  balls  and  on  both  occasions  the  ball  flew  between  midwicket  and  long  on  for  six  and  we  soon\nclosed out the match.\nIn  the  second  Test  at  Hyderabad,  starting  on  2  March,  we  played  brilliantly  to  reach  503,  with\nMurali Vijay scoring 167 and Cheteshwar Pujara making a double century. Australia had managed a\ndisappointing 237 in their first innings and the second-wicket partnership of 370 between Vijay and\nPujara  meant  our  bowlers  had  enough  runs  on  the  board  to  bowl  the Australians  out  in  the  second\ninnings without us having to bat twice.\nI got out to James Pattinson for seven, getting the faintest edge down the leg side. I was cursing my\nluck for having got bat on ball, prompting the caught-behind appeal, but was also surprised to see the\numpire,  after  he  had  initially  given  me  not  out,  deciding  to  check  with  the  third  umpire  after  a\nprolonged  rethink.  In  a  series  in  which  there  was  no  Decision  Review  System  (DRS)  there  was  no\nreason for the umpire to reconsider his decision once he had given me not out. If he had not seen or\nheard the nick, that should have been the end of the decision. I do not know what prompted the rethink\nand it was strange to see the umpire deciding to check with the TV umpire.\nThe  reason  that  India  has  steadfastly  refused  to  use  the  DRS  in  bilateral  series  is  because  the\ntechnology  is  inconclusive  on  occasions.  We  witnessed  how  random  it  could  be  during  our  tour  of\nEngland  in  2011–12,  when  DRS  resulted  in  a  number  of  wrong  decisions.  We  are  not  against\ntechnology per se, but we do think that DRS needs to be close to 100 per cent correct before we can\naccept it. We feel it is a perfectly reasonable stance and I am sure we will revisit the situation when\nthe technology has improved. The other point is that we believe that the technology used should be the\nsame across all countries, because only then can we achieve uniformity in decision-making.\nAt  Hyderabad,  we  won  the  match  comfortably  and  were  gradually  starting  to  establish  a\nstranglehold over the series. We had never beaten Australia 4–0 in a Test series, but such a scoreline\nwas now beginning to seem a distinct possibility.\nThe third Test started in Mohali on 14 March and the Australians scored a healthy 408 in their first\ninnings, with Mitchell Starc contributing 99 batting at number nine. Our response was emphatic, with\na 289-run opening partnership between Shikhar Dhawan, playing superbly on debut for his 187, and\nMurali Vijay, who got his second consecutive Test hundred. I started my innings well and was feeling\nconfident  when  Steve  Smith,  the  part-time  leg-spinner,  came  on  to  bowl.  I  had  never  faced  Smith\nbefore and walked up to Vijay to check if the ball was turning. Vijay said that Smith was giving the\nball a rip and I should play for turn. The first ball I faced was the perfect line and length – and it didn’t\nturn an inch. I was out caught bat-pad at forward short leg for 37.\nOn the last day at Mohali, we needed 133 to win and I went in to bat with the score at 70–2, intent\non finishing the game. Australia were keeping things tight and we finally reached a stage when Dhoni\nand I were at the crease and we needed 24 off twenty-five balls to win. They had bowled a couple of\ntight overs and we needed to play a few shots to ease the pressure. I did exactly that to a delivery from\nMitchell  Starc  that  was  angled  in  to  me.  I  hit  it  over  mid  off  for  a  four.  In  the  next  over  by  Peter\nSiddle, I missed a ball that came in and hit my pad before rolling off on the off side. I thought the ball\nhad gone towards point and started running. The ball had actually gone more towards short cover, but I\nhad  committed  myself  to  the  single.  David  Warner  came  darting  in  and  picked  up  the  ball  before\nflinging himself on the stumps. I had no chance. It was a spectacular effort from him and I was left to\nrue not checking where the ball had travelled. It was disappointing not to stay till the end and close out\nthe game myself, but Dhoni and Ravindra Jadeja did the job. We were 3–0 up and a whitewash looked\ndistinctly possible as we headed to Delhi for the fourth and final Test of the series.\nAt Delhi, one look at the wicket was enough to suggest that it would assist the spinners from day\none. I remember telling Anjali that the match was not likely to last the distance and I might well be\nhome early. I said the same thing to Ajit, who had come to Delhi to watch the game. Sure enough, the\nspinners got into the action very early and it promised to be a low-scoring game. Australia batted first\nand scored 262, a reasonable total in the conditions. In reply we made 272, of which I scored 32.\nIn the second innings, our spinners ran through Australia, with Ravindra Jadeja again picking up a\nfive-for. Ashwin and Jadeja had bowled well right through the series and Jadeja had even managed to\nget the Australian captain Michael Clarke out a number of times, which may have started to play on\nClarke’s  mind.  Some  of  the  deliveries  Jadeja  bowled  to  him  in  the  first  three  Tests  were  excellent\n(Clarke was injured for the fourth), pitching on leg and spinning right across his bat face to hit the off\nstump.\nEventually we cruised to a win, thanks to a courageous knock from Pujara, who batted with a broken\nfinger and remained unbeaten on 82. It was an act of real courage and will do him a lot of good in the\nrest of his career.\nIt was the first time in our history that we had achieved a 4–0 series win against Australia and the\nvictory could not have come at a better time for Indian cricket. At one swoop we had managed to erase\nthe  unpleasant  memories  of  losing  to  England  at  home  and  the  team  had  started  to  come  together\nagain.\nFrom  a  personal  point  of  view,  I  had  started  the  series  well  in  Chennai  and  had  looked  good  in\npatches, but I lost my wicket after getting a start on at least three occasions. Unfortunately for me, I\nwas not able to get a century in the 2012–13 season and it was something I was looking to change at\nthe start of the following season.\nNew Zealand in India 2012\n1st Test.

            "title": "WINDING DOWN\n",
            "data": "After surgery on my left hand in London in July 2013, I worked hard on getting back to full fitness. It\nwas painful and time-consuming and it was a great relief to be able to resume practice by the end of\nAugust, some weeks ahead of the Champions League Twenty20. However, the period of recuperation\nwas  never  boring.  When  I’d  got  back  from  England  my  friends Atul  Ranade,  Faisal  Momen  and  I\ndecided to start cycling as a part of my cardio exercise. Atul was already cycling on alternate days to\nstay fit, and Faisal decided to join in, making the whole thing more enjoyable. On the first day, after\ncycling for nearly forty minutes in the early morning, we decided to attempt the really steep incline\nthat  leads  to  the  Mount  Mary  Church  in  Bandra.  Faisal  opted  out  when  he  saw  the  steepness  of  the\nslope, but Atul and I embarked on the climb. It was a difficult one, and by the time we reached the top\nwe were both breathing heavily. I suggested repeating it, and Atul and I tried going up again. On the\nsecond attempt, I overtook Atul halfway up, but when I got to the top I started feeling seriously giddy.\nI tried drinking some water and did a few stretching exercises, but things did not improve and, by the\ntime Atul had reached the top too, I was seeing white in front of my eyes and was forced to sit down\non  a  divider  on  the  road  with  my  arms  stretched  out.  In  panic, Atul  even  started  fanning  me  with  a\nhuge leaf that he plucked from a nearby tree! Things did not improve and I soon realized that what I\nreally needed was to lie down to get the blood circulation back to my brain. When I told Atul, he saw\nan  open-top  jeep  standing  next  to  the  church  and,  in  desperation,  suggested  I  lie  down  in  it.  That’s\nwhen I spotted a rickshaw and asked Atul to persuade the driver to allow me to lie on the back seat for\na  while.  The  driver  was  shocked  to  see  me  in  that  state,  to  say  the  least.  As  Atul  stood  outside\nexplaining to him what had happened, I got onto the seat and lay flat for a good five minutes. Never in\nmy life had I imagined I’d be doing such a thing just a few minutes from my house, at 6 a.m.! When I\nwas feeling a little better we thanked the rickshaw driver profusely for his help, paid him a hundred\nrupees and started slowly cycling back down the hill. By now Faisal, at the foot of the hill, was getting\nimpatient, because he thought we must be drinking tea at the top, and he was stunned to hear what had\nhappened. However, none of this deterred me from continuing with my training ahead of what turned\nout to be my last few months in international cricket.\nI had announced my retirement from the IPL in May 2013 and this was to be my last Champions\nLeague. To my great satisfaction, the Mumbai Indians won the trophy, beating Rajasthan Royals in the\nfinal, and it meant my team had won both the IPL and the Champions League in my last season as a\nplayer. We had gelled well as a team and Rohit Sharma did well as captain.\nIt was during the Champions League campaign that, for the first time in my career, I found I had to\nforce  myself  to  go  to  the  gym.  It  was  also  the  first  time  in  my  career  that  I  didn’t  feel  bad  about\nmissing a session. Now, it wasn’t as if I hit the gym every day of my career. I have always tended to\ntrain in bursts, before taking a break for a few days. But this was the first time that I just did not feel\nlike pushing myself. I was also taking far longer to recover from injuries and was feeling a number of\naches and pains.\nIndia’s  next  scheduled  Tests  were  in  South  Africa  in  December  2013  and  that’s  where  I  was\nexpecting to play my 200th Test match. After that, there was an away series in New Zealand in early\n2014 and I was looking forward to both tours. A number of my friends had discussed the 200th Test\nmatch with me and made plans to travel to South Africa to watch me reach this milestone. In fact, I\nhad  to  keep  reminding Ajit  to  book  his  tickets.  But  then  the  BCCI  announced  that  there  would  be  a\ntwo-Test home series against the West Indies at the beginning of November 2013 and I had to rethink\nmy  plans.  It  was  then,  and  I  don’t  know  exactly  how  and  when,  that  the  thought  of  retirement  first\ncame to me. I started to wonder whether those two Tests against the West Indies should be my last.\nI remember discussing it with Anjali and Ajit. We were sitting in the first-floor lounge of my house\nwhen I told them that I was thinking about retiring after the West Indies series. The second Test would\nbe my 200th and I would not have another opportunity to retire on home soil till the end of 2014 and I\nwasn’t sure if I could battle with injuries for that long. There was no point in dragging things out if my\nheart wasn’t in it.\nAnjali and Ajit were both fully supportive and Anjali said that she was behind me in anything that I\ndecided. She just wanted me to be sure that I wouldn’t regret the decision a few months down the line.\nAjit agreed that the timing was right and that it was a good decision to retire in India. Playing my final\nTest away from home just wouldn’t be the same.\nOnce I had made up my mind, I decided to ask the BCCI if they would consider allotting the second\nTest to Mumbai. It would mean that I would play my last series in front of my home crowd and above\nall I would get my mother to watch me for the first time in my life. My mother had never watched me\nplay  live  and  this  was  something  I  really  wanted  to  do  for  her.  I  had  begun  my  first-class  career  in\nMumbai in 1987 and playing my last Test at the Wankhede would mean I had completed the circle. It\nwas as if I was being told from above that this was an opportunity to thank cricket. There would be no\nbetter occasion to pay my respects to the game than in a farewell Test match in Mumbai.\nWhen I talked through the decision with my friend and manager Vinod Naidu and our close friend\nAparna  Santhanam,  it  turned  out  to  be  a  memorable  and  magical  evening.  I  opened  a  bottle  of\nchampagne and we toasted the game of cricket and all the years gone by. There was no sense of gloom\nor  dejection  or  talk  of  anything  ending.  Instead,  there  was  a  sense  of  joy,  of  anticipation  and\nfulfilment.  We  laughed  and  reminisced  about  twenty-four  years  on  the  cricket  field  and  chatted\nhappily about the upcoming series. It all convinced me that I had taken the right decision. The timing\nwas  perfect.  It  was  a  call  made  from  the  heart.  I  wasn’t  prepared  to  let  my  mind  interfere  in  the\ndecision  because  the  mind  has  a  habit  of  asking  too  many  awkward  questions.  I  had  not  given  a\nthought to what I would do after retirement. I was simply sure that this was the best time to stop.\nIt was a day later, on the morning of 10 October 2013, that I called BCCI President N Srinivasan to\ncommunicate my decision to retire. He said that while the BCCI would always want me to continue\nfor as long as I wanted, they would also back me on any decision. He was clear that retirement was\nentirely  my  call.  Then  I  raised  the  question  of  allotting  my  last  Test  match  to  Mumbai  and  he\npromised to look into the matter. Allotting a Test match to a city based on a request from a player was\na rare and touching gesture.\nBefore speaking to the BCCI president, I had informed my family that I was planning to retire. Sara\nasked  me  if  I  was  retiring  from  all  forms  of  cricket.  I  realized  she  was  feeling  emotional  about  the\ndecision. It was natural, but she did her best to conceal it. Arjun was in South Africa at the time and I\nknew that telling him wouldn’t be easy. I was aware of just how much my cricket meant to him. Arjun\nand I used to laugh about retirement and I often joked that the next series would have to be my last as\nI was getting so old. This time it wasn’t a joke.\nOn the morning of 10 October, I called Arjun in South Africa and asked him to go to a room where\nhe  would  be  alone  as  I  wanted  to  tell  him  something  very  important.  I  rang  him  back  after  a  few\nminutes and told him that the two Tests against the West Indies in November would be my last. There\nwas complete silence at the other end, so much so that I had to ask if he was still on the line. He said\nhe  was  but  he  wasn’t  able  to  say  anything  else  and  actually  hung  up  on  me.  I  knew  he  was  crying.\nThere was a lump in my throat. I was suddenly feeling a sense of emptiness and needed a few minutes\nto regain my composure. He called me back ten minutes later and chatted away about what he was up\nto  in  South Africa,  but  my  retirement  was  not  mentioned  again.  It  was  his  way  of  coping  with  the\nnews.\nThe  decision  was  made  public  that  afternoon  and  it  was  an  emotional  time  for  my  family.  I  felt\nremarkably calm, though, because I was convinced I had made the right call at the right time. Soon\nafter the news broke, Anjali suggested to me that she should go and fetch Sara from school. On the\nway  back, Anjali  read  Sara  the  kind  messages  she  had  received  on  her  phone,  telling  her  they  were\nindicative  of  what  the  world  thought  about  her  baba.  When  Sara  got  home,  she  ran  up  to  me  and,\nwithout saying a word, just hugged me tight. This time I couldn’t help getting emotional too. I was a\nhappy father. My children mean the world to me and it touched me to know that they were proud of\nwhat I had achieved. I hoped it also meant that they understood why I had had to go away for such\nlong periods when they were growing up.\nBy now a crowd had started to build outside the house and I was overwhelmed at the outpouring of\nemotion. I received a huge number of text messages and calls and made plenty myself. Despite trying\nmy best to speak to every person who played a key role in my life, I missed out on calling many. I am\nsure  they  will  all  understand  how  much  I  value  their  contribution  and  that  the  omission  was  totally\nunintentional.\nI  continued  sending  messages  late  into  the  night,  but  that  is  not  to  suggest  I  was  having  trouble\nsleeping  again.  On  the  contrary,  I  slept  very  well  and  was  very  much  at  peace  with  myself.  On  the\nother hand, I was still an active cricketer. I wasn’t prepared to lead a retired cricketer’s life just yet\nand I was looking forward to resuming practice the next day and doing my best for Mumbai and India\nin the month I had left.\nGetting ready for the West Indies\nMy practice sessions following the announcement were very interesting. The next morning I went to\nthe  Mumbai  Cricket Association’s  Bandra  facility  to  practise  and  the  groundsmen  came  over  to  see\nme. They all thanked me for my contribution to cricket, when it should have been me thanking them\nfor all they had done for me. Some became quite emotional and said they would miss me now that I\nwouldn’t be turning up to practise any more. I reminded them that I hadn’t retired quite yet, and in any\ncase I would still come and practise after I’d retired – there was no way I was going to leave them in\npeace!\nThe evening before my last session at the MCA, I called the supervisor Ajay Desai and asked him to\ninform all the groundsmen and helpers that I would like to meet them personally the next morning. It\nwas my way of recognizing everything they had done for me and thanking them for their contribution\nto  my  career.  I  carried  tokens  of  appreciation  for  them  and  it  was  deeply  touching  to  see  them  all\nwaiting patiently for me. As I thanked them for their help and support, some hugged me and a few had\ntears in their eyes. It was a very moving moment and I felt humbled. The best part, however, was yet\nto come. When I’d finished, I was expecting the groundsmen to resume their normal duties. However,\nto my surprise they announced that on this occasion they weren’t going to leave me. Instead, they all\nstood there while I went through my routine. Having spent a lifetime with the groundsmen in Mumbai,\nI must say I was overwhelmed at the gesture.\nIt was a similar story with the groundsmen at the Wankhede. I have known these men for years and\nmany watched me grow up as a cricketer. Once again I brought tokens of appreciation for all of them\nand we took a group photograph to mark the occasion. I will always remember the way they treated\nme.\nIt  was  during  my  early-morning  training  sessions  at  the  Wankhede  that  I  met  up  with  the  MCA\nofficials and told them about the ramp I required for my mother. I did not want to leave a single thing\nto chance and also checked out the box allocated to my family. In fact, it was when I was doing the\ninitial recce that I realized that my mother would find it difficult. She is not in the best of health and it\nwould  have  been  difficult  getting  her  up  to  the  box  from  the  car.  That’s  when  we  decided  that  she\nshould sit in the president’s box instead and for safety I had also booked a room for her at the Garware\nPavilion in case she felt tired and wanted to rest.\nHaving checked the route the wheelchair would have to take from the car to the ramp and finally to\nthe president’s box, and being fully convinced that it could all be done, I went ahead with the plan of\nformally inviting her. Being able to do this thing for my mother made the retirement Test match all\nthe more special.\nThe last Ranji match\nWhen I first met my team-mates from the Mumbai Ranji Trophy team after the announcement, a lot\nof them came up and asked me why I had decided to retire when I could have carried on for a while. It\nwas an encouraging reaction and it felt good to see the faith they continued to have in me.\nThe last Ranji Trophy game I played for Mumbai was in Lahli against Haryana, which is a state just\nnorth  of  Delhi,  and  it  turned  out  to  be  quite  an  experience.  Before  travelling  to  Lahli,  I  spoke  with\nAnirudh Chaudhry, who was our manager in England in 2011, and his father Ranbir Singh Mahendra,\nwho was our manager in Australia in 1991–92, at the Haryana Cricket Association. Anirudh had made\nspecial arrangements to put some of us up in the Chief Minister’s guest house, which he said was a\nvery  relaxing  place  to  stay.  He  had  also  arranged  for  extra  security  in  order  to  make  us  feel\ncomfortable.\nWe flew to Delhi on our way to Lahli and when we landed we were told by Anirudh that we should\nhave  lunch  at  the  ITC  Maurya  hotel  while  he  made  the  final  arrangements.  There  was  a  pleasant\nsurprise  awaiting  me.  As  soon  as  we  stepped  into  the  lobby  the  lights  were  dimmed  and  I  was\naccorded a red-carpet welcome by the general manager Anil Chadha, with all the employees standing\nin line and throwing rose petals at me. It was a deeply touching gesture.\nAfter  lunch  we  left  for  Lahli.  It  took  us  approximately  two  and  a  half  hours  to  drive  to  the  guest\nhouse, but all along the route people were waving banners and posters and all sorts of things, making\nit  a  very  memorable  journey.  When  we  finally  reached  the  guest  house,  I  was  surprised  to  see  the\nbutler who had been with me in Delhi already stationed there to take care of us! He informed us that\nfour of them had travelled from Delhi at Anirudh’s request and would be looking after us all the way\nthrough the match.\nAt  Lahli  I  felt  like  trying  some  local  food  and  asked  the  manager  to  recommend  some  authentic\nlocal cuisine. The manager did not say anything in response and left the room, but then he apologized\nto Zaheer and informed him that Anirudh had left strict instructions about what should be served to us.\nHe had made it clear that every day breakfast, dinner and snacks would come from the ITC Maurya in\nDelhi and that nothing else should be served, to avoid any risks. I must say it really was a maharaja-\nstyle outing. The Haryana Cricket Association had gone out of their way to spoil us.\nThe stadium was forty minutes away from the guest house but the roads were nearly empty and it\nwas never a problem reaching the ground in the morning. It was a beautiful arena and the conditions\nwere tailor-made for fast bowling. The outfield was a little soft to start with because of the dampness\nand  it  would  be  a  good  test  of  my  fitness  ahead  of  the  West  Indies  series.  Soft  outfields  can  put\npressure  on  calves  and  hamstrings  and  if  I  had  no  trouble  on  this  outfield,  I  would  be  fine  at  Eden\nGardens or the Wankhede, the venues for my 199th and 200th Test matches.\nMumbai’s first Ranji match of the season, which was also my last, turned out to be fascinating. A\nlarge crowd had come along and the build-up to the four-day game was unprecedented. Media from\nIndia and the rest of the cricket-playing world had descended on the small town of Lahli and while the\npolice tried their best to keep them at a distance, I knew that my every move was followed and every\npractice session filmed.\nIn  the  first  innings  I  was  out  bowled  for  five  to  a  ball  that  jumped  a  little  and  ricocheted  off  my\nelbow onto the stumps. It was a rather disappointing dismissal after all the build-up. At Lahli, most\nmatches are low-scoring and, sure enough, our reply to their first-innings total of 134 was only two\nruns more. It was a keenly contested match and in our second innings we were set 240 to win, which in\na way was more like 280 because of the slow outfield.\nI had a brief chat with my team-mates in the innings break and emphasized to them the need to be\naggressive after the opposition had bowled close to fifty overs, which would be approximately around\nteatime. On a pitch offering assistance to the fast bowlers, that was the best time for batsmen to cash\nin and score quickly, because that was when the ball would be older and the opposition bowlers tired.\nBetter to take a few chances then than wait for the morning, when the bowlers would start fresh and\nthe new ball would also be due.\nDhawal Kulkarni, the fast-medium bowler, and I had a really good partnership towards the end of\nthe day’s play and I kept telling him that he needed to hang in there at any cost. There wasn’t much\nbatting left after him and a new batsman would find it difficult on the greenish pitch. Dhawal batted\nextremely well and showed great courage. He was hit on the helmet a couple of times but never got\nrattled or gave up. By the end of the day we needed 39 runs to win, with four wickets left.\nIt  was  a  9  a.m.  start  on  the  last  day  and  it  was  important  to  make  the  right  call  with  the  roller.\nHaving seen the wicket, I told Zaheer, our captain, that the grass was dry at the top but at the bottom it\nwas still wet. It still needed some sun to dry out completely. If we took the heavy roller the wetness\nwould spread to the top and the pitch would turn damp. I suggested that we should not use a roller but\njust leave the surface as it was, because all that was required was 39 runs, which wouldn’t take more\nthan an hour or so to get.\nAgain Dhawal batted well and showed great resilience and we managed to knock off the runs in an\nhour or so. His contribution of 16 was critical because on that surface we could easily have lost the\nlast four wickets for ten runs. I was pleased to remain unbeaten on 79 in my final Ranji outing. It was\na satisfying victory and a good way for Mumbai to start their Ranji Trophy campaign.\nAt  the  end  of  the  game,  the  Haryana  team  gave  me  a  guard  of  honour  and  my  own  team-mates\nchaired  me  off  the  ground  on  their  shoulders.  While  the  gesture  was  touching,  it’s  always  slightly\nconcerning being carried on the shoulders of team-mates. There’s a good chance of being dropped and\nwith  two  Test  matches  still  to  play,  it  wouldn’t  have  been  a  great  way  to  get  injured.  The  Mumbai\nteam had also arranged for a send-off in the room adjoining our dressing room, which was particularly\ntouching. The Mumbai Cricket Association secretary Nitin Dalal was also there and a cake was cut in\nmy honour and all the players said a few words. A number of them turned emotional as they spoke,\nand some had tears in their eyes. It was all very moving.\nThat wasn’t the only surprise at Lahli. Unbeknown to me, Anirudh had invited a few of my closest\nfriends – Sameer Dighe, Faisal Momen and Jagdish Chavan – to watch the game. He had sent them\ntickets  himself  and  also  arranged  for  their  accommodation.  On  the  evening  of  the  first  day  of  the\ngame, the local manager came up to me and said there was someone waiting to take a picture and it\nwouldn’t take more than a minute. I stepped outside, ready to pose, only to see my friends grinning at\nme. It was a great feeling to see them in Lahli. They have all been by my side through good and bad\nand it was a pleasant surprise to have them around me for my last domestic game.\nWinning  that  Ranji  Trophy  match  meant  I  had  won  all  my  final  matches  in  every  format  of  the\ngame so far. It was a record I was extremely proud of and I hoped I would be able to keep it intact in\nmy  final  series  for  India.  Lahli  had  served  as  good  preparation.  Now  I  was  looking  forward  to  my\npenultimate Test match in Kolkata.\nFarewell Eden Gardens\nHaving relaxed for a couple of days at home in Mumbai, and having visited the temples in Mumbai\nand  Goa  that  I  always  visit  to  seek  the  blessings  of  God,  I  arrived  in  Kolkata  on  the  evening  of  3\nNovember  2013.  As  always,  Dwarkanath  and  Kalpa  Sanzgiri  had  sent  me  ladoos  (a  type  of  Indian\nsweet) on the eve of the series to wish me luck. There was a mini welcome ceremony arranged by the\nCricket  Association  of  Bengal  at  the  airport  and  there  were  a  lot  of  people  inside  the  terminal  to\nreceive me. In fact, the police were finding it very difficult to control the crowd and I had to hurry into\nthe lounge to give them time to calm things down.\nThe situation showed no signs of improving in the next half an hour and I realized that the longer I\nwaited, the more difficult it would be for us to leave the airport. I called the police and informed them\nI had to leave for the hotel as soon as possible. A large number of security personnel accompanied me\nto the car while the crowd showered me with rose petals. The affection was overwhelming. Kolkata\nhas  always  been  a  city  that  loves  its  cricket  and  the  people  there  have  always  embraced  me  with\nwarmth. I was delighted that the 199th Test match was being played at Eden Gardens, one of the best\ncricket grounds in the world when it comes to atmosphere.\nDuring my first two days in Kolkata, Pintu (Raghunath Basak) gave me a massage for almost two\nhours each day to help me relax and my friend Samar Paul brought me food from home and we all had\ndinner  in  my  room  with  Virat,  Rohit, Ajinkya  and  Pragyan  Ojha.  I  have  known  Samarda  from  1991\nand was first introduced to him by Dilip Vengsarkar. Every visit to Kolkata has been made special by\nthe food that Samarda has kindly brought from home. Pintu too has been a constant in Kolkata from\n1994, and it has been a routine that he would give me a massage and we would then end up having\ndinner  in  my  room. Also,  Joydeep  Mukherjee  would  always  take  me  to  the  Kali  temple  whenever  I\nwent to Kolkata, visits I have always looked forward to.\nWhen I arrived at the ground on the morning of 4 November, I was very surprised by what was there\nto  greet  me. A  wax  statue  of  me  was  standing  right  outside  the  dressing  room  and  the  walls  were\ncovered with pictures of me from different stages of my career.\nI tried to follow my normal pre-match routines as far as that was possible. I batted for a while in the\nnets, but I was fairly cautious while playing football with the rest of the boys, because the last thing I\nwanted to do was get injured. Afterwards we went back to the hotel and I went to the gym and later\nrelaxed in my room watching movies and listening to music. It was all very normal. I ate dinner with\nmy team-mates and was in a very good frame of mind.\nSince the retirement announcement every news channel had been talking about my career and I tried\nto  cocoon  myself  from  it  all  as  much  as  possible.  I  did  see  some  of  the  coverage,  however,  and\ncouldn’t  help  thinking  about  how  many  years  had  gone  by  since  my  debut.  It  was  pleasing  to  be\nreminded of everything I had been able to achieve in my career, but I still had a job to do and I didn’t\nwant to let myself get distracted. I did not want to retire mentally before I finally called it a day at the\nend of the second Test in Mumbai.\nThe 199th Test\nOn  6  November  2013,  the  West  Indies  won  the  toss  and  decided  to  bat  first.  There  was  a  sizeable\ncrowd  at  Eden  Gardens  on  the  first  morning.  Making  a  rare  exception  to  her  routine  of  praying  at\nhome, Anjali had come to see the match and it was a real surprise for me to see her and Arjun in the\nstands. When I had spoken to her the night before, I had sensed that something was cooking but didn’t\nknow exactly what. It turned out she had spoken with my friend and co-writer Boria Majumdar and\nplanned the visit as a surprise. I became aware of her presence only when an announcement was made\nthat she was in the stands. I must say it was a delight to see them both when we met up at the end of\nthe day’s play.\nThis is what Anjali told me about making that special trip to Kolkata. It was a ritual with us that she\nwould wish me well on the eve of a Test series. Before leaving for Kolkata, I had said to Anjali that it\nwould be the last time she would have to do so. Anjali told me later that as I left for the airport with\nAjit, who always dropped me off whenever I travelled, she could not control her tears. She had to go to\nmeet Arjun’s cricket coaches, who had come from England, at the Waterstones Club, which was close\nto  the  airport,  and  so  she  was  in  a  car  behind  me  for  most  of  the  way,  with  tears  rolling  down  her\ncheeks. Even when she reached the club, she just could not control her emotions and burst into tears\nwhen she met up with Arjun’s coaches. The poor chaps did not understand why coming to see them\nhad made her cry! That’s when she told them the real reason and then they insisted on accompanying\nher to Kolkata to watch me play.\nWe had bowled the West Indies out for 234 on the first day and I was keen to do well when I went\nout  to  bat  on  the  morning  of  day  two.  I  had  played  a  couple  of  good  shots  when  I  fell  to  an  lbw\ndecision I wasn’t very happy with. These things are part of the game, of course, but it seemed to me\nthat the ball from the off-spinner Shane Shillingford was going over the stumps. It was frustrating, but\nthere was nothing I could do about it. Replays showed the ball was going at least six inches over the\nstumps.\nHaving lost a few quick wickets, we were under pressure when Rohit Sharma and Ashwin started a\nrebuilding  act.  Rohit  played  spectacularly  on  debut  and  Ashwin  was  the  perfect  foil.  Both  got\nhundreds and their partnership of 280 was instrumental in winning us the Test. It had taken the wind\nout  of  the  West  Indies’  sails.  Mohammed  Shami,  another  debutant,  finished  the  job  in  the  second\ninnings with an excellent spell of reverse-swing bowling, taking five wickets to add to his four in the\nfirst innings. He was getting the ball to move appreciably and has a bright career ahead.\nWe won the match by an innings and 51 runs in under three days. The awards ceremony turned into\na special occasion, with tricolour balloons released to commemorate my 199th Test match, and I left\nEden Gardens with some really pleasing memories.\nTime to gather my thoughts\nI  decided  to  go  back  to  Mumbai  on  the  evening  of  8  November  to  give  myself  more  time  at  home\nbefore my 200th Test match. At Kolkata airport on the way back, a huge crowd started to walk with\nme everywhere I went. Luckily for me, there were eight armed commandos with me at the airport, as\notherwise things might have got a little out of hand. It was slightly disconcerting because there was no\nway I could oblige the entire crowd with pictures and autographs and I asked the airport manager to\ntake me to the lounge as quickly as possible. We walked to the far end of the terminal past the security\ncheck and it was only then that I saw it was a public lounge.\nThe crowd was continuing to follow me around and I asked the manager if we could go and sit in\nanother lounge instead. He said this was the only available option after the security checkpoint and he\nwould cordon off the area where I would be sitting. I wasn’t prepared to do this because I didn’t want\nto give people the wrong message. It was not as if I wasn’t willing to meet them or sign autographs. I\nhave never refused to sign autographs, because I consider it my duty towards my fans, who have stood\nby me throughout my careeer. However, if I did start to sign or pose for pictures, there was a risk that\nit would become a serious security issue inside the lounge.\nIt was then that I advised the duty manager to check if the aircraft was ready, hoping that I could go\nand sit in it. I was informed it was being cleaned but I thought it was still better to board it than to\nkeep the crowd at a distance. I went in and sat all by myself. Once inside, I posed for pictures with all\nthe cleaners and the crew that had brought the aircraft to Kolkata and who were still on board. I waited\npatiently as the crew changed. Once the new crew had taken up their positions, I asked them to screen\noff  one  side  so  that  the  incoming  passengers  wouldn’t  start  taking  pictures,  which  might  end  up\ndelaying the flight. I was happy to sign autographs once we were airborne rather than inconveniencing\nother passengers and delaying the journey. The crew agreed and I settled down in my seat.\nSoon after take-off it hit me that I was travelling to play the last Test match of my career. It had all\ncome to an end very quickly. In no time I would have a microphone in my hand and would be expected\nto  speak  to  the  world,  to  say  something  to  all  my  fans  and  supporters  about  what  I  was  feeling.  It\nwould also be my last opportunity to thank the people who had stood by me over the years. And yet I\nhad not planned what I would say or exactly who I needed to thank. I knew I had to be careful, because\non a previous occasion I had had to make a similar speech and thought I had thanked everybody – until\nthe commentator Harsha Bhogle came to the rescue and whispered in my ear that I hadn’t mentioned\nAnjali! Sitting on that plane from Kolkata, I realized that I had two hours when no one would call me\nor speak to me and it was the ideal time to think about my speech. I took out my iPad and started to\nmake a note of all the people I needed to thank, going right back to the very beginning.\nWhile I was doing so, I had to keep reminding myself that I still had ten days left in my career and\nthat I was going to enjoy every moment on the field. I had two innings left and wanted to leave my\nfans with memories they would cherish. As the flight started its descent into Mumbai, I thought back\nto the years gone by. It had been quite a journey.\n"

            "title": "THE FINAL TEST\n",
            "data": "Thanks to the early finish at Kolkata, I spent two quiet days at home before rejoining my team-mates.\nI made the most of the time to myself ahead of all the frenzy. The only cricket I played was with my\nson in our back yard, when he tried to test me out with some short-pitched stuff – with a tennis ball. It\nwas great just to have some fun with him.\nOn  11  November,  I  met  up  with  the  rest  of  the  team  on  the  Mumbai  Sea  Link  on  our  way  to\nKandivali  Gymkhana,  which  was  being  renamed  after  me  in  a  function  organized  by  the  Mumbai\nCricket  Association.  It  was  a  great  honour.  It  is  an  excellent  facility  and  I  hope  it  will  serve  as  a\nbreeding ground for young talent in the region.\nWhen we eventually got to the Taj Mahal Palace hotel, I couldn’t believe the lengths they had gone\nto. My pictures were in all the lifts and on the nineteenth floor, where the team was staying, there were\nphotographs  on  every  wall.  In  my  own  room  every  little  thing  you  could  think  of  was  personalized.\nFrom the soaps and shampoos to the pillow covers, everything had my name on it, and every day the\nTaj management sent me a personalized sweet of some kind, such as cake or chocolate.\nI was busy sorting things out in my room when I got a call from our coach, Duncan Fletcher. He\nsaid the team wanted to honour me by wearing special shirts that said ‘Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar –\n200th Test match’, and he asked if I had any problems with this. I said it was an absolute privilege and\nI was overwhelmed.\nThere was no doubt that this would be a Test match like no other. There was a huge media presence\neverywhere,  bigger  than  ever  before.  They  were  outside  the  hotel  at  all  hours,  waiting  to  catch  us\ngetting on and off the bus on our way to practice. I did my best not to be affected by it all. It helped\nthat the practice sessions were just the same as they’d always been and I batted in the nets and played\nfootball with the boys just as I had always done.\nSporting the tricolour\nOne  thing  I  was  looking  forward  to  was  playing  with  some  special  new  bat  stickers  and  grips.  The\ndesign featured the tricolour and I had worked closely on it with my sponsors Adidas and my manager\nVinod Naidu. The stickers had been specially designed for my last game and they were never going to\ngo on any other bat in the market. I looked forward to revealing them when I batted in my 200th and\nfinal Test match.\nThe stickers and grips arrived the day before the game and I didn’t want to let anyone see them till\nthe  morning  of  the  match.  I  borrowed  Rohit  Sharma’s  bag  to  take  all  my  bats  to  my  room,  where  I\nspent  hours  changing  the  stickers  and  putting  on  the  new  grips.  I  have  always  worked  on  my  bats\nmyself and have spent many happy hours doing repairs over the years. I enjoyed the close connection\nwith  the  tools  of  my  trade  and  the  rest  of  the  team  often  took  advantage  of  this.  If  anyone  wanted\nsandpaper, glue or bat tape, bat coat, grip or gripper, it was me they would come to.\nI couldn’t resist taking a picture of the new-look bats to send to Anjali. I was very happy with the\nway  they  had  turned  out.  The  tricolour  has  always  meant  the  world  to  me  and  this  was  my  way  of\nshowing  respect  to  my  country.  I  was  looking  forward  to  using  them  the  next  morning.  As  I  was\npacking my clothes and other things to take to the ground the following day, my sense of excitement\nwas also tinged with sadness at the thought that I only had a few days left.\n14 November 2013, day one of the final Test\nAfter a good night’s sleep, I got up at my usual time on the morning of the first day. I made my own\ntea in the room, which I have always done, and went through my routine of taking a shower and doing\nmy  prayers  before  putting  on  my  headphones  and  going  down  to  board  the  team  bus,  which  was\nsurrounded by at least a thousand people.\nWhen we got to the ground, I carefully brought out my bats from Rohit’s bag with their new livery\nand walked out to practise with them. They were looking superb and my team-mates all commented\non them as they could see the thought that had gone into the design. There’s no doubt they added to\nthe occasion.\nOne  way  and  another,  it  was  a  morning  like  no  other.  First  the  Mumbai  Cricket  Association\ncongratulated  me  on  notching  up  200  Test  matches  and  then  the  Government  of  India  launched  a\nspecial stamp to celebrate the achievement. I was told that I was only the second living person to be\nhonoured with a stamp in that way, the first being Mother Teresa. What could I say to such a thing?\nFrankly, I was speechless.\nCricket at last\nMost of the crowd wanted to see me bat, so a loud cheer went up when it was announced that India had\nwon the toss. But they were quickly disappointed when MS Dhoni opted to field because the wicket\nwas expected to offer some assistance to the fast bowlers in the morning. There was some bounce and\neven the spinners might come into play on the first day.\nAs we left the dressing room, the captain gave me the honour of leading the team out, which I did\nthroughout the match. Gestures like that are memories I will always cherish. As we stepped onto the\nfield  the  team  also  presented  me  with  a  special  commemorative  cap,  and  I  spoke  to  them  briefly\nduring  the  team  huddle.  I  reminded  them  of  our  duty  towards  the  sport  and  the  need  to  uphold  the\nspirit of cricket at all times. I consider it the duty of every generation of cricketers to set examples for\nthe next generation and inspire the youth to embrace the sport. It is the least we can do for the sport\nthat has given us our identity.\nAs I looked around the stadium I was feeling really happy that, for the first time, my mother was\nthere to watch me. In fact, my entire family, my wife and children, brothers, sister and her husband,\nuncle and aunt, were all in the stadium and I felt blessed by the affection and support the crowd was\nshowering on me. There was nothing more a sportsman could have asked for. All that was needed to\ntop it off was to perform well with the bat to leave my final mark on the sport I love so much.\nWe bowled brilliantly to get the West Indies out for 182 on the stroke of tea, at 2 p.m., with Pragyan\nOjha taking five wickets and Ashwin three. My mother, I was later told, had been planning to leave the\nground  at  tea  when  a  friend  told Anjali  that  there  was  a  chance  I  might  bat  after  all  if  India  lost  a\ncouple of wickets. Anjali asked my mother if she felt up to it and luckily she agreed to stay on, hoping\nto see me bat from the stands for the first time.\nThe gods must have been listening and it was a little past 3.30 p.m. when, with the score at 77–2, I\nwalked out to the middle. The crowd was chanting ‘Sachin Sachin’ and the West Indians and the on-\nfield umpires gave me a guard of honour as I walked to the pitch to take strike. I tried to soak in every\nmoment.  I  was  relieved  to  score  the  first  run  quickly.  After  that,  I  started  to  enjoy  myself,  my\nconfidence growing with every boundary.\nIt was during the last over of the first day’s play that my mother was shown on the stadium’s giant\nscreen for the first time. The moment she appeared the crowd gave her a standing ovation. As soon as\nI saw her face I got very emotional. I now had to deal with two very difficult challenges – protecting\nmy wicket and controlling my emotions. I took my time to settle down before taking guard again.\nIn hindsight, I’m not sure it was such a good idea to show my mother on the screen with just one\nover  to  go  for  the  day.  The  broadcasters  could  have  shown  her  on  television  but  to  show  her  in  the\nstadium when I was doing my best to survive the day was perhaps inappropriate. While I understand\nthey were trying their best to make the occasion memorable, and I much appreciate them for doing so,\nthis one thing could perhaps have been done differently. It did not stop with my mother. One after the\nother, they kept showing my family members on the screen, much to the delight of the huge crowd.\nIt all made it very difficult to concentrate and I had to keep telling myself that I needed to shut out\neverything that was happening around me. On this day of all days I wanted to give it my absolute best.\nHappily,  I  managed  to  survive  the  day  and  was  unbeaten  on  38.  I  was  delighted  to  have  stayed  out\nthere  for  close  to  an  hour  and  a  half. As  I  was  about  to  leave  the  park,  I  raised  my  bat  towards  my\nfamily.\nWhen I look back at these moments they feel surreal, to say the least. My mother’s reaction when\nshe first saw herself on the giant screen, her tongue coming out in embarrassment because she wasn’t\nused  to  the  limelight,  was  so  natural  that  I  had  tears  in  my  eyes.  The  crowd  standing  up  to\nacknowledge her was more than I could have asked for as a son and I am deeply thankful to everyone\nfor showing her that affection and respect.\nAmidst  all  the  emotion,  I  was  actually  rather  surprised  to  see Arjun  in  the  ground.  Before  I  left\nhome for the Test match we had had a lengthy discussion about whether he should watch me or play\nhis own Under-14 match. It was eventually decided that he should go to his match. Yuvraj Singh then\nkindly dropped Arjun off at his game to try and make up for his disappointment at missing my 200th\nTest match. All of Arjun’s friends were delighted to see Yuvi and Arjun was proud to be dropped off\nby him. Arjun’s day then got even better when his team got a walkover and he jumped into a taxi and\nfound his way to the Wankhede. He managed to convince the police of who he was and the next thing I\nknew was when I saw him on the giant screen, working as a ball boy.\nBack in the hotel that evening, I tried to relax and enjoy the moment. I was exhausted but happy that\nI  was  still  batting.  I  ate  dinner  and  retired  early,  knowing  that  I  had  important  work  to  do  in  the\nmorning.\n15 November 2013, day two of the final Test\nThe next day I got up at my usual time and, having finished my morning routine, put my headphones\non and listened to some music. As I was walking down to the lobby and then to the bus, people wished\nme luck. There were happy and excited crowds on both sides of the road. I just tried to concentrate on\nthe  music  and  stay  removed  from  what  was  happening  around  me.  Clearly,  it  was  not  business  as\nusual, but I did not want the enormity of the occasion to get to me.\nAfter reaching the ground, I took out my bats and went out to the middle. It was our batting day and\non such days players are allowed to follow their own routine. On fielding days, we are expected to take\na few catches and do some fielding practice. Duncan said that we just needed to do a few stretching\nexercises and then we were on our own. I went to the nets to bat to a few throw-downs and then came\nback to the dressing room to get ready.\nWhen we went out to bat I was feeling surprisingly good. Every time I took guard and saw the new\nbat sticker I felt a strange feeling of elation. I had always played cricket for the tricolour. Now I could\nsee  it  on  my  bat  every  time  I  looked  down.  It  was  a  terrific  feeling.  My  mother’s  presence  in  the\nstands only added to my determination.\nTino Best produced an inspired spell of fast bowling, testing me on quite a few occasions. It was\nonly  later  that  I  learned  that  it  was  his  son’s  birthday  and  he  had  promised  him  he  would  get  my\nwicket as a birthday present. On one occasion when I was beaten, he appealed and I laughed and asked\nwhat  was  wrong  with  him,  because  the  ball  was  miles  away  from  my  bat!  In  the  next  over  I  could\nsense that he was about to bowl me a bouncer and I was ready for it. I had all the time in the world to\nplay the upper cut – but I missed it by a few inches. I don’t know why I wasn’t able to connect with\nany of the short balls. I finally managed to play a cover drive and as the ball was being retrieved from\nthe boundary, I mock-punched Tino Best and said it was his lucky day because I had missed out on at\nleast four boundaries against him. We are good friends off the field and fierce competitors on it.\nI brought up my half-century with a straight drive and raised my bat to my mother. The delighted\ncrowd kept shouting ‘Sachinnn Sachinnn’ and it was tremendous to be out there. Even when I was not\nfacing the ball, the crowd kept chanting.\nAbout five minutes after the first drinks break, Narsingh Deonarine was given the ball. I was aware\nthat he was an occasional off-spinner who would probably bowl only three or four overs. I told myself\nthat I should do nothing foolish against him but just take a few singles. Only if there was a loose ball\nshould I put it away for a boundary.\nThe ball I got out to bounced slightly more than I expected. It was a fuller delivery and faster than\nhis normal one. I thought I could cut it to backward point for four. I had played a similar shot against\nShillingford a little earlier. It all happened in a flash. Before I knew it, I had played the shot and the\nball was on its way to Darren Sammy at slip. It hit his chest and he caught it on the rebound. I was out,\nfor 74, with the score at 221–3.\nAs I turned to walk to the pavilion, my mind was flooded with thoughts. Why did I have to play that\nstroke?  Why  cut  the  ball  when  I  could  have  played  it  to  cover  for  a  single  or  even  left  it  for  the\nkeeper?  What  prompted  me  to  go  for  the  cut  shot  at  all?  Throughout  my  career  I  have  always\nquestioned my shot selection after getting out and it was no different in that innings.\nThat’s when the thought came to me that there might not be another innings. It dawned on me that\nthis  could  well  be  the  last  time  I  walked  off  the  field  as  an  India  batsman.  The  way  the  match  was\ngoing, there was a good chance we wouldn’t have to bat again. It was this thought that prompted me to\nstop  for  a  moment  and  take  in  the  crowd  and  raise  my  bat  to  them  for  all  their  support  and\nencouragement. But the disappointment was still very much with me as I walked up the steps to the\ndressing room. I knew I had missed out on a big one.\nAs  he  had  in  Kolkata,  Rohit  Sharma  batted  exceptionally  well  and  his  second  consecutive  ton,  as\nwell  as  113  from  Pujara,  helped  us  to  a  total  of  495  and  a  lead  of  313.  In  their  second  innings,  the\nWest  Indies  top  order  fell  without  offering  much  resistance.  At  one  point  the  crowd  was  actually\ncheering for Chris Gayle. They wanted the game to go on so that I could bat one more time! It was\nfunny and unreal at the same time.\nBy  the  end  of  the  second  day  it  was  fairly  clear  that  we  would  win  by  an  innings  and  that  16\nNovember 2013 would be my last day as an Indian cricketer.\n16 November 2013, day three of the final Test\nThe West Indies started the day at 43–3 and were soon 89–6. It was at the fall of the seventh wicket\nthat I started to feel that there wasn’t long to go. Each wicket was bringing the final moment nearer. A\nquest of twenty-four years was about to come to an end.\nWhen  the  ninth  wicket  fell  and  I  ran  in  to  congratulate  the  bowler,  Dhoni  asked  me  to  stay  away\nbecause the team was planning something. I went and stood next to the square-leg umpire while the\nrest were all huddling in the middle. I could not stop myself from getting emotional. It was all ending\nso quickly.\nWithin  a  few  overs  the  final  moment  came.  Mohammed  Shami  took  the  final  wicket  with  a  full\ndelivery  that  knocked  out  Shannon  Gabriel’s  middle  stump.  I  rushed  in  again  from  my  fielding\nposition  and  picked  up  a  stump,  saying  to  one  of  my  team-mates  ‘Yeh  stump  to  mujhe  chahiye  hi\nchahiye.’  (I  want  this  stump  at  any  cost.)  But  again  Dhoni  asked  if  I  could  stand  apart  for  a  while\nbecause they had planned something special.\nI stood at the other end of the pitch while the rest of the team finalized the plan. Then Ravi Shastri\nwalked across the ground to do his television broadcast. He congratulated me on my career and said\nsome  very  kind  things  about  my  contribution  to  the  game.  I  was  still  just  about  holding  myself\ntogether. Then the team started another guard of honour, only this time it was different. They stood in\ntwo lines on both sides of the wicket with me in the middle, but as I started walking, players from the\nend  of  the  lines  kept  running  to  the  front  in  order  to  extend  the  guard  of  honour  all  the  way  to  the\nboundary.\nI  could  no  longer  hold  back  my  tears.  It  was  just  too  much.  Such  respect  and  affection  was\noverwhelming and I will always remember the way my team-mates gave me my final send-off. By the\ntime I walked off the ground I was openly crying. I could not look people in the eye and had to shake\nhands with the opposition players with my face turned to the ground. I did not want them to see me cry\nlike a child. I did the same with our support staff and then just ran up the stairs to the dressing room\nand went straight to the bathroom.\nThat’s where I broke down completely. I cried for about ten minutes until I finally told myself that\nenough was enough. I washed my face and came back to the dressing room with a towel over my head\nand sat in my seat completely alone. My team-mates had given me space and there was no one in the\ndressing room to disturb me. I looked at my kitbag and thanked my gear for being with me all my life.\nI was gradually starting to come to terms with the moment when someone came in to say that Brian\nLara and the West Indian team were waiting for me and that Brian had planned something special. It\nwas rather unusual for an opposition team to do anything like that and it was very touching. My 200th\nTest was also Shivnarine Chanderpaul’s 150th and Brian congratulated us on our achievements. Brian\nand I have been great friends and his words meant a lot to me. I then spoke briefly about Chanderpaul\nand the West Indian way of cricket before all the players took pictures with me.\nI  went  back  to  the  dressing  room  to  get  ready  to  walk  out  with  the  team  for  the  presentations.\nSomeone from Star Sports, the host broadcasters, came up to me and said that Ravi Shastri would ask\nme a few questions at the presentation, but I said I would rather speak by myself. I also said I would\nlike to go on for a bit longer than usual, if they were agreeable, and suggested that it might be better if\nI was given the microphone after the players had collected their awards. They readily agreed and said I\ncould go on for as long as I wanted, as they had all the time in the world for me!\nA speech from the heart\nI was finally given the microphone at the end of the presentation, but before I could speak the crowd\nstarted chanting ‘Sachinnn Sachinnn’ and they just would not stop. As I have said many times before,\nthese chants will reverberate in my ears for as long as I live. I asked the crowd to calm down and not\nmake me more emotional than I already was. I had also brought a bottle of water in case I was choked\nwith emotion in the middle of it all.\nI took from my pocket the list of people I wanted to thank that I had written on the plane back from\nKolkata after the first Test match. The challenge now was to say different things about each one. They\nall meant the world to me and I wanted to thank them individually for their contribution. Somehow,\nthe words just came to me. I spoke my heart out.\nWhen  they  showed  my  team-mates  Sourav,  Rahul  and  Laxman  on  the  big  screen  I  spoke  about\nthem. When I was speaking about my wife I could see her break down in front of me and Sara trying\nto console her. Arjun also comforted his mother as I went on to thank the best partner I have ever had.\nI can never say enough about her.\nI  thanked  my  fans  and  the  supporters  of  Indian  cricket,  who  have  always  stood  by  me.  It  did  not\nmatter to them if I scored a zero or a hundred. They were always there with me and their support has\nbeen my biggest source of strength.\nIt is pertinent to recount here an incident I will remember forever, one that demonstrates what my\nfans  mean  to  me.  I  was  once  in  Chennai  when  I  had  the  opportunity  to  meet  a  number  of  special\nchildren. Their teacher pointed to one child in a wheelchair and said that he was my biggest fan and\nhis ultimate ambition was to hold my bat. I put my arm around him and told him, ‘Okay, done. Let’s\nplay cricket together.’ Immediately, I sent someone to fetch my bat and a couple of tennis balls from\nthe dressing room. To my complete amazement and absolute utter delight, the boy stood up and played\nthree balls on his own. For him to be able to do so was incredible. We all gave him an ovation and I\nhave often spoken about this child, who left a lasting impression.\nAfter a while I told the crowd I’d finish soon, only for them to scream ‘Nooooooooo!’ It seemed\nthey wanted me to carry on. In the end I spoke for twenty minutes, the longest I have ever spoken at a\nstretch in my life. I genuinely do not know how I did so at such a difficult time; it was as if someone\nfrom  above  had  blessed  me.  Other  than  that,  I  can’t  explain  how  I  managed  to  navigate  the  speech\nwithout a hiccup.\nOnce  it  was  over,  we  went  for  a  victory  lap  and  my  team-mates  decided  to  carry  me  around  the\nWankhede.  No  one  had  left  the  stadium  and  I  waved  to  the  crowd  from  the  shoulders  of  my  team-\nmates and thanked them for being with me all through my career. I had always hoped that this final\nlap  of  honour  would  be  one  in  victory,  because  that  would  mean  so  much  to  me  as  a  cricketer.  In\ndefeat it would not have had even 10 per cent of the significance it had in victory. We had won the\nmatch  and  the  series  in  style  and  it  meant  I  had  won  all  of  my  final  matches  in  all  formats  of  the\ngame.\nThat  was  when  Virat  Kohli  reminded  me  about  going  out  to  pay  my  respect  to  the  pitch  and  I\nwalked out to the middle by myself. It was a very personal moment and something I had always meant\nto do at the end of my innings in cricket. I would be no one without the 22-yard strip and it had taken\ncare of me all my life. It was only right to thank the pitch for everything and do namaskar (offer my\nrespects).\nOne final goodbye\nAs I was sitting by myself back in the dressing room, Virat walked up to me again. I could see tears in\nhis  eyes.  He  held  out  his  hands  and  said  his  dad  had  given  him  these  threads,  the  kind  that  Indians\nwear around their wrists for good luck, and he had always wondered who he would give them to. It had\nto  be  someone  very  special.  Then  he  handed  them  to  me  before  touching  my  feet  as  my  younger\nbrother. I was speechless. I held him tight and said, ‘Arre tu yeh kya kar raha hain? Tujhe yahan nahi,\nyahan  hona  chahiye.’  (What  are  you  doing  touching  my  feet?  You  should  be  giving  me  a  hug.)  I\ncouldn’t say another word because I felt choked with emotion. A lump had formed in my throat and\nfinally I had to ask Virat to leave, knowing I would burst into tears if I tried to say anything else. It\nwas a gesture I can never forget and I wished Virat all the success in his career.\nA  little  later,  I  called Ajinkya  Rahane,  my  Mumbai  team-mate  who  was  our  twelfth  man  in  this\nmatch, to a room adjoining our dressing room. I had known Rahane for years and had seen how much\nhe loves the game. He had served cricket with complete dedication and commitment over the last few\nyears.  I  said  to  him  that  he  might  feel  hard  done  by  what  had  happened  in  his  career  so  far,  but  he\nshould continue to be the way he is, for I was sure Ajinkya would get another chance. For the moment\nhe might feel it is a cruel game, but I was certain the game would take care of him in the future if he\ncontinued to serve it the way he had always done.\nFinally it was time to leave the stadium. It had been hours since the match had ended and I had not\neaten a morsel since breakfast. The Taj management had sent me some haleem (a kind of stew with\nlentils and meat) and I handed it to Anjali so that we could take it back to the hotel to eat there. As we\nboarded the bus, Sourav Ganguly, one of my good friends over the years, came to congratulate me one\nfinal time. I got off the bus to give him a hug. Dada and I have shared some great moments over the\nyears and have known each other since we were thirteen years old.\nOnce the bus was on its way to the hotel, Anjali asked me to go and stand next to the driver to wave\none  final  goodbye  to  the  supporters.  They  were  waiting  on  both  sides  of  Marine  Drive  and  were\ncelebrating  and  shouting  ‘Sachinnn  Sachinnn’.  We  had  to  pinch  ourselves  to  believe  what  we  were\nseeing.  This  was  my  final  send-off  and  these  people,  each  and  every  one  of  them,  were  making  it  a\nfairy tale. I don’t really know what I had done to deserve all this, but it made me feel really blessed to\nwitness these scenes. I was leaving the cricket field with no regrets whatsoever.\nAn unexpected honour\nThere was a special reception in the hotel lobby and it was not until 3 p.m. that Anjali and I finally\nmanaged some privacy in my room. I took out the haleem that we had brought back and we were both\nenjoying it and sipping champagne when I received a phone call from the prime minister’s office. I\nwas told that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh wanted to speak to me and after a couple of moments\nthe PM came on the line. He congratulated me on my career and thanked me for serving Indian cricket\nfor  twenty-four  years.  Then  he  told  me  that  in  recognition  of  my  contribution  to  Indian  sport  I  had\nbeen awarded the Bharat Ratna, India’s highest civilian honour.\nAfter I put down the phone, I asked Anjali to stop eating and took her to the table where I had put\nall  my  gods  and  goddesses.  We  both  placed  our  hands  on  the  table  and  I  told  her  that  she  was  now\nlooking at a Bharat Ratna. Anjali screamed in delight and gave me a hug. We did not say a thing to\neach other for a while as the news sank in. Every dream of mine was being fulfilled and I thanked God\nfor  all  the  blessings  and  kindness.  Then  we  opened  a  bottle  of  champagne  to  celebrate  and,  to  be\nhonest, the champagne just flowed from then on.\nWe  watched  television  for  a  while  as  we  tried  to  come  to  terms  with  the  enormity  of  the  award.\nEvery channel was showing it as Breaking News. I was the first sportsperson in the history of India to\nbe awarded the Bharat Ratna. It was certainly the biggest honour of my life and coming on the day I\nhad bid my final goodbye to cricket made it all the more special. I had already been appointed to the\nRajya  Sabha,  the  upper  house  of  the  Indian  Parliament,  in  2012,  and  now  to  be  given  the  highest\ncivilian honour by the Government of India meant a lot to me. As a Member of Parliament, my plan is\nto  work  towards  making  sports  that  much  more  viable  in  India  (Sport  for All)  and  also  to  integrate\nsports within the educational framework in the country.\nThe honour was formally conferred on me at the Rashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi on 4 February 2014 in\nan extraordinary ceremony at the Ashok Hall. As we entered the hall, a military band started playing\nand when my name was called, it was one of the most unbelievable moments of my life. To receive\nthe Bharat Ratna in front of my wife and daughter (Arjun could not make it because he had a game in\nMumbai),  and  to  be  told  by  the  President  that  the  whole  country  was  proud  of  me,  gave  me  an\nincredible sense of fulfilment. It was a day when I felt well and truly overwhelmed.\nWhen I started out as a sixteen-year-old against Pakistan in 1989, I could never have imagined how\nit would all end. I always tried to work as hard as I could and give my best for the team. While I may\nhave failed on occasions, I never gave up. It was my country I was playing for and that was all I had\nwanted to do when I had started to play under the strict vigil of Achrekar Sir in Shivaji Park.\nIn all those years, I never compromised on hard work and discipline and always tried to push the bar\nhigher. To achieve something worthwhile for India was a dream I chased all my life.\nFull circle\nIn my farewell speech at the Wankhede Stadium, I mentioned that during my career Achrekar Sir had\nnever said ‘well done’, but the truth is that that was never something I expected from him. The smile\non his face was enough to understand he was pleased with my performance. The day after my speech,\nhowever, I went to visit Achrekar Sir, to thank him for all he had done for me, to mark the fact that we\nhad come full circle. It was very important for me to pay my respects in this way.\nSir doesn’t speak much these days, but I think that he was happy.\nThe  other  thing  I  did  on  the  day  of  my  retirement  was  attend  a  farewell  party  at  the  Waterstones\nclub in Mumbai organized by Anjali and my friends Sanjay and Rachna Narang. I have fond memories\nof  the  club  because  it  was  where Anjali  and  the  Narangs  had  organized  our  World  Cup  celebration\nparty  as  well.  On  that  occasion,  the  party  was  organized  overnight  and  invites  sent  entirely  by  text\nmessage.  This  time,  however,  it  was  far  more  elaborate  –  something  I  found  out  later.  Friends  and\nwell-wishers  from  around  the  world  had  turned  up  to  celebrate  my  career  and  we  spent  a  lovely\nevening  together.  Some  of  my  closest  friends  stayed  till  ten  the  following  morning  and  we  enjoyed\nreminiscing about the best moments from a twenty-four-year-long career.\nWest Indies in India 2013\n1st Test.

            "data": "I leave Indian cricket in safe hands. I have played with the current generation of cricketers who now\nconstitute the core of the Indian team. Batting, I feel, will continue to be our strength and the current\ncrop, which is a good mix of experience and youth, will surely play together for many years and serve\nthe country with distinction. On the bowling side, while some of our bowlers are doing well, we need\nto find a few more talented fast bowlers. In the past we have had some really good bowling pairs, but\nwhat  we  need  now  is  a  bowling  unit  that  will  play  for  the  team  at  the  same  time.  This  is  a  tough\nchallenge, but with the depth of talent available in the country, I am sure we are up to it.\nFinally,  the  game  of  cricket  itself  is  extremely  vibrant.  Cricket  is  the  only  sport  that  has  three\ndistinctive  formats  and  each  format  has  a  constituency  of  its  own.  While  Test  cricket  will  always\nremain the pinnacle, one-day international cricket too is in good shape, with the Champions Trophy\nand the fifty-over World Cup seeing tremendous support the world over. Also, Twenty20 continues to\nattract the youth, as shown by the popularity of the IPL.\nA  lot  of  people  have  asked  me  what  I  will  be  doing  in  the  future.  Frankly,  I  don’t  know.  When  I\nstarted out playing cricket at eleven years of age I had no idea I would go on to play for India or would\nplay 200 Test matches. All I knew was that I wanted to play the game well and enjoy every moment. I\nstayed in the moment and lived each situation as they came to me.\nI had never thought there would come a time when I would not be able to go out for walks with my\nchildren,  or  take  them  shopping,  that  going  out  to  watch  a  film  or  taking  my  family  out  for  dinner\nwould require meticulous planning. However, I don’t regret any of it, for all of that is a small price to\npay for the affection and warmth the people of my country have showered on me all the way through\nmy career.\nI am in a very similar state at the start of my second innings. All I am doing now is trying to spend\na lot of time with my family and sometimes not doing anything at all! This was impossible when I was\nan  active  cricketer  but  now  I  am  learning  to  take  time  off,  and  I  must  say  I  am  enjoying  myself  at\nhome. Cricket allowed us to have a place of our own, our current bungalow in Bandra West, and Anjali\nand I have taken care to ensure every little thing has been handpicked by us. From growing up as a\nchild in a one-room place next to Shivaji Park, to sleeping in our living room with Ajit till 1994, to\nfinally  owning  a  bungalow  in  Bandra  –  by  being  true  to  cricket  I  have  been  able  to  fulfil  a  lifelong\ndream of owning my own house.\nSomething  else  I  always  wanted  was  to  have  my  parents  stay  with  me,  and  while  my  dream  of\nhaving my father to stay at my own place was not fulfilled – he passed away in 1999, and we moved\ninto our apartment in La Mer in 2000 – my mother now stays with me, giving me immense fulfilment\nand pride. In fact, on 28 September 2011, the day we moved into our bungalow in Bandra West, I took\nmy  mother  to  the  bungalow  at  six  in  the  morning  and  showed  her  around  the  whole  house  in  her\nwheelchair. I had driven her in a small car to avoid attention and wheeled her in her chair myself for\nthe entire time. She was actually the first person to enter the house, which made the occasion all the\nmore joyous.\nAs I start my second innings, I will do exactly what I did when I was eleven, live and enjoy each\nmoment.  I  don’t  know  where  my  life  is  heading,  nor  do  I  want  to  predict  anything.  I  will  just  take\nthings as they come, as I did when I played my first innings. There is one difference, however. As I\nmove on in life I will always live with the satisfaction that I managed to play the first innings my way,\nand have been able to leave behind a legacy I can now look back on with pride.\n"

            "title": "FAREWELL SPEECH\n",
            "data": "All my friends … settle down, let me talk, I will get more and more emotional … my life, between 22\nyards for twenty-four years, it’s hard to believe that that wonderful journey is coming to an end, but I\nwould like to take this opportunity to thank people who’ve played an important role in my life. Also,\nfor  the  first  time  in  my  life  I  am  carrying  this  list,  to  remember  all  the  names  in  case  I  forget\nsomeone. I hope you understand … it’s getting a little difficult to talk, but I’ll manage.\nThe most, the most important person in my life, and I have missed him a lot since 1999 when he\npassed away, my father. Without … without his guidance, I don’t think I would have been standing\nhere in front of you. He gave me freedom at the age of eleven and told me ‘Chase your dreams, but\nmake sure you don’t find short cuts. The path might be difficult, but don’t give up.’ And I have simply\nfollowed his instructions. Above all, he told me to be a nice human being, which I will continue to do\nso, I have tried my best. Every time, every time I have done something special, whenever I’ve showed\nmy bat, it was for my father, so I miss him today.\nMy  mother,  I  don’t  know  how  she  dealt  with  such  a  naughty  child  like  me.  I  was  not  easy  to\nmanage.  She  must  be  extremely  patient.  For  a  mother,  the  most  important  thing  is  that  her  child\nremains safe and healthy and fit, and that’s what she was most bothered about and worried about. She,\nshe took care of me … for the last twenty-four years that I have played for India, but even before that,\nshe started praying for me the day I started playing cricket. She just prayed and prayed and prayed,\nand I think her prayers and blessings have given me the strength to go out and perform, so a big thank\nyou to my mother for all the sacrifices.\nIn my schooldays, for four years I stayed with my uncle and my aunt, because my school was quite\nfar from my home, and they treated me like their son. My aunt – after having had a hard day’s play, I\nwould be half asleep and she would be feeding me food so that I could go and play again tomorrow. I\ncan’t forget these moments. I am like their son and I am glad that it has continued to be the same way.\nMy eldest brother, Nitin, and his family have always encouraged me. My eldest brother doesn’t like\nto  talk  much,  but  the  one  thing  he  always  told  me  is,  ‘Whatever  you  do,  I  know  you  will  give  a\nhundred per cent, and I have full confidence and faith in you.’ His encouragement meant a lot to me.\nMy sister, Savita, and her family, was no different. The first cricket bat of my life was presented to me\nby my sister, it was a Kashmir willow bat … but that is where the journey began. She is one of those\nmany who still continue to fast when I bat, so thank you very much.\nAjit, my brother, now what do I talk about him? I don’t know, really. We’ve, we’ve lived this dream\ntogether. He was the one who sacrificed his career for my cricket. He spotted the spark in me. And it\nall started from the age of eleven when he took me to Achrekar Sir, my coach, and from there on my\nlife  changed.  You  will  find  this  hard  to  believe  that  even  last  night  he  called  me  and  we  were\ndiscussing my dismissal, knowing that there was a remote chance of batting again, but just that, the\nhabit  which  we  have  developed  and  the  rapport  that  we  have  developed,  since  my  birth,  it  has\ncontinued and it will continue. Maybe even when I’m not playing cricket we will still be discussing\ntechnique. Various things, various things we agreed upon, my technique, and so many technical things\nwhich I didn’t agree with him, we have had arguments and disagreements, but in the end when I look\nback at all those things, if that hadn’t happened in my life, I would have been a lesser cricketer.\nThe most beautiful thing happened to me in 1990 when I met my wife, Anjali. Those were, those\nwere special years and it has continued and it will always continue that way. I know, I know Anjali,\nbeing a doctor, there was a wonderful career in front of her. When we decided to have a family, Anjali\ntook  the  initiative  to  step  back  and  say  that,  ‘You  continue  with  your  cricket  and  I’ll  take  the\nresponsibility  of  the  family.’  Without,  without  that,  I  don’t  think  I  would  have  been  able  to  play\ncricket  freely  and  without  any  stress.  Thanks  for  bearing  up,  bearing  with  all  my  fuss,  all  my\nfrustrations and all sorts of rubbish that I have spoken – I normally do. Thanks for bearing with me\nand always staying by my side through the ups and downs. You are the best partnership I’ve had in my\nlife.\nThen, then the two precious diamonds of my life, Sara and Arjun. They have already grown up. You\nknow, my daughter is sixteen, my son is fourteen. Time has flown by. I wanted to spend so much time\nwith them on special occasions like their birthdays, their annual days, sports day, going on holidays,\nwhatever. I have missed out on all those things. Thanks for your understanding. Both of you … have\nbeen so, so special to me … you cannot imagine. I promise you, I promise you, for fourteen years and\nsixteen years I have not spent enough time with both of you, but the next, the next sixteen years or\neven beyond that, everything is for you.\nMy, my in-laws, Anand Mehta and Annabel, both have been so, so supportive, loving, caring … I\nhave  discussed  on  various,  various  things  in  life,  generally  with  them,  and  taken  their  advice. You\nknow, it’s so important to have a strong family who is always with you and guiding you. Before you\nstart clapping, the most important thing they did was allowing me to marry Anjali, so thank you very\nmuch.\nIn the last, in the last twenty-four years that I have played for India I have made new friends, and\nbefore  that  I  have  had  friends  from  my  childhood.  They  all  have  had  a  terrific  contribution.  Right\nfrom, you know, as and when I have called them to come and bowl to me in the nets, they have left all\ntheir  work  aside  and  come  and  helped  me.  Be  it  joining  me  on  holidays  and  having  discussions  on\ncricket, when I was a little stressed and wanting to find a solution so that I could perform better – all\nthose moments, my friends were with me. Even for whenever I was injured, I would wake up in the\nmorning because I could not sleep, I thought my career was over because of injuries, that’s when my\nfriends have woken up at three o’clock in the morning to drive with me and just make me believe that\n‘Your  career  is  not  over.’  Life  …  would  be  incomplete  without  all  those  friends.  Thanks  for  being\nthere for me.\nMy cricket career started when I was eleven. The turning point of my career was when my brother\ntook me to Achrekar Sir, my coach. I was extremely delighted to see him up in the stands. Normally\nhe sits in front of the television and he watches all the games that I play. When I was … when I was\neleven/twelve, those, those were the days where I used to hop back on his scooter and play a couple of\npractice  matches  a  day. You  know,  first  half  of  the  innings  I  would  be  batting  on  Shivaji  Park,  the\nsecond half some other match at Azad Maidan. Sir would be taking me all over Mumbai to make sure\nthat I got match practice.\nOn a lighter note, in the last twenty-nine years Sir has never ever said ‘well played’ to me because\nhe thought I would get complacent and I would stop working hard. Maybe he can, he can push his luck\nand wish me now ‘well done’ on my career, and because there are no more matches, sir, in my life. I\nwill  be  witnessing  cricket,  and  cricket  will  always  stay  in  my  heart,  but  you  had  an  immense\ncontribution in my life, so thank you very much.\nMy cricket for Mumbai started right here on this ground, the Mumbai Cricket Association, which is\nso dear to me. I remember landing from New Zealand at four o’clock in the morning and turning up\nfor a game at eight o’clock here, just because I wanted to be part of Mumbai cricket, not that anyone\nforced  me  or  Mumbai  Cricket Association  pressurized  me  to  be  here,  but  that  was  for  the  love  of\nMumbai cricket. And thank you very much – the president is here – thank you very much, along with\nyour team, for taking care of me and looking after my cricket.\nThe dream was obviously to, to play for India, and that’s where my association with BCCI started.\nBCCI was fantastic, right from the, from my debut. Believing in my ability, selecting me in the squad\nat the age of sixteen was, was a big step. So thanks to all the selectors for having, having faith in me\nand the BCCI for giving me the freedom to express myself out in the middle. Things would have been\ndifferent if you had not been behind me, and I really appreciate your support. Especially when I was\ninjured, you were right with me and making sure that all the treatments were taken care of and I got fit\nand fine, playing back for India.\nThe  journey  has  been  special,  the  last  twenty-four  years.  I  have  played  with  many,  many  senior\ncricketers,  and  even  before  that  there  were  many  senior  cricketers  whom  I  watched  on  television  –\nthey  inspired  me  to  play  cricket  and  play  it  the  right  way.  Thanks  so  much  to  all  those  senior\ncricketers. Unfortunately I have not been able to play with them, but I have high regards for all their\nachievements and all their contributions.\nWe see it on the mega-screen, Rahul, Laxman, Sourav – Anil is not here – and my team-mates right\nhere  in  front  of  me. You  are,  you  are  like  my  family  away  from  home.  I  have  had  some  wonderful\ntimes with you … it’s going to be difficult not to be part of the dressing room, sharing those special\nmoments. All the coaches, for, for their guidance, it has been special for me. I know when MS Dhoni\npresented  me  the  200th  Test  match  cap  on  day  one  morning,  I  had  a  brief  message  for  the  team.  I\nwould like to repeat that: I just feel that all of us are so, so fortunate and proud to be part of the Indian\ncricket team, serving the nation. Knowing all of you guys, I know you will continue to serve the nation\nin the right spirit and the right values. I believe, I believe we have been the lucky ones to have been\nchosen by the Almighty to serve this wonderful sport. Each generation gets this opportunity to merely\ntake care of this sport and serve it to the best of our ability. I have full faith in you that you’ll continue\nto  serve  the  nation  in  the  right  spirit,  to  the  best  of  your  ability,  and  bring  all  the  laurels  to  our\ncountry. All the very best.\nI would be failing in my duties if I didn’t thank all the doctors, the physios, the trainers, who’ve put\nthis difficult body together to go back on the field and to be able to play. The amount of injuries that\nI’ve  had  in  my  career,  I  don’t  know  how  you’ve  managed  to  keep  me  fit,  but  without  your  special\nefforts, it would never have happened. I mean, the doctors have met me at weird hours. I mean, I have\ncalled them from Mumbai to Chennai, Mumbai to Delhi, wherever, and then they have just taken the\nnext flight and they’ve left their work and they’ve come, they’ve treated me, which has allowed me to\nplay. So a big thank you to all three of you for keeping me in good shape.\nMy  dear  friend,  late  Mark  Mascarenhas,  my  first  manager  –  we  unfortunately  lost  him  in  a  car\naccident in 2002, but he was such a well-wisher of cricket, my cricket, especially Indian cricket. He\nwas so passionate. He understood what it takes to represent a nation and gave me all the space to go\nout and express myself, and never pressurized me to do this ad or promotion, whatever the sponsors\ndemanded. He took care of that and today I miss him, so thank you, Mark, for all your contribution.\nMy current, my current management team, WSG, for, for repeating what Mark has done, because\nwhen  we  signed  the  contract  I  exactly  told  them  what  I  want  from  them  and  what  it  requires  to  be\nrepresenting India. They have understood that and respected that, so thank you very much, WSG.\nSomeone who has worked closely with me for fourteen years is my manager, Vinod Naidu. He is\nmore like my family and all the sacrifices, spending time away from his family for my work, has been\nspecial, so a big thank you to your family as well, for giving so much time for my work with Vinod.\nIn my schooldays, when I performed well, the media backed me a lot. You continue to do that till\nthis  morning.  Thank  you  so  much  to  all  the  media,  for  supporting  me  and  appreciating  my\nperformances. It surely had a positive effect on me. Thank you so much to all the photographers as\nwell,  for  those  wonderful  captured  moments  will  stay  with  me  for  the  rest  of  my  life,  so  to  all  the\nphotographers a big thank you.\nI know my speech is getting a bit too long, but this is the last thing I want to say … I want to … I\nwant to thank all the people here who’ve flown in from various parts of the world and supported me\nendlessly, whether I scored a zero or I scored a hundred-plus, whatever. Your support was so dear to\nme and it meant a lot to me.\nWhatever you’ve done for me – I know I’ve met so many guys who’ve fasted for me, prayed for me,\ndone all sorts of things for me – you know, without all that, life wouldn’t have been like this for me. I\nwant to thank you from the bottom of my heart, and also say that time has flown by rather quickly, but\nthe memories that you have left with me will always be with me for ever and ever, especially ‘Sachin,\nSachin’. That will reverberate in my ears … till I stop breathing.\nThank you very much. If I’ve, if I’ve missed out on saying something, missed out on a few names, I\nhope you understand. Goodbye.\nWankhede Stadium, Mumbai\n16 November 2013\n"
